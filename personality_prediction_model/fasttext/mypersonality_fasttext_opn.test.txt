__label__0 i  couldn't  focus  and  *propname*  was  really  annoyingly  antsy,  so  we  decided  to  take  a  walk  and  we  both  feel  much  better.    now  shower  and  memo-writing  time...

__label__0 is  wishing  her  sister,  *propname*,  a  happy  th  birthday!!
__label__0 coffee,  memo-writing//editing,  and  grey's//private  practice...
__label__0 is  putting  together  a  breakfast  casserole  to  bake  for  breakfast  in  the  morning  and  waiting  on  *propname*  to  get  here..  :)
__label__0 outlining  property  all  day...  *propname*'s  coming  to  see  me  tonight  so  that's  a  great  motivation  to  get  my  work  done!!!  :)    can't  wait  to  see  him!!!
__label__0 lots  to  be  happy  about---  my  standard  :-://  mins  of  class  monday  at  the  law  school  is  over,  my  apartment  is  totally  unpacked,  and  *propname*  is  coming  to  visit!
__label__0 like  everyone  else,  my  poor  *propname*  is  sick...  wish  i  was  there  to  take  care  of  him...  :(
__label__0 just  cut  *propname*  trying  to  give  her  a  little  trim...  :(    i'm  taking  it  worse  than  she  is...  poor  baby...    now  *propname*  and  i  are  going  to  grab  us  a  bite  to  eat,  then  i'm  trapping  him  in  my  apartment  cuz  he's  not  allowed  to  leave  tomorrow.
__label__0 *propname*'s  gone  home  and  i  will  be  studying  the  next  two  days  for  a  scary  property  midterm  on  thursday  that  will  be  worse  than  going  to  the  dentist----then  i  have  a  dentist  appointment  right  afterward....  basically  i'm  doing  something  i  don't  usually  do  and  that  is  sulking  and  feeling  really  sorry  for  myself.    but,  home  on  thursday  after  the  exam//dentist  appt.!!!  :)
__label__0 is  a  sleepy  girl...  curling  up  in  the  bed  with  miss  gigi  to  read  a  book,  chatting  with  my  love,  and  then  sleeping  as  long  as  i  want  to.    i  love  not  having  friday  classes.
__label__0 will  hot  chocolate  make  me  feel  better?
__label__0 had  to  go  ahead  and  cook  some  chili  after  *propname*  made  it  sound  so  good...  homework  and  crossing  my  fingers  for  mcdonnell,  bolling,  and  cuccinelli!
__label__0 taking  *propname*  for  a  walk  and  then  attempting  to  write  this  memo...
__label__0 ahhh...  this  is  beautiful  *propname*...  i  have  so  many  true,  yet  politically  incorrect  things  to  say,  but  will  instead  keep  them  to  myself...
__label__0 *propname*  just  broke  her  collar  when  i  took  her  out...  with  broad  street  right  outside  i  only  had  a  minor  panic  attack.
__label__0 today  is  one  of  those  "i  don't  like  law  school..."  days.    my  solution=  pretending  that  i'm  not  in  law  school  for  the  rest  of  the  day...  tv  time.
__label__0 went  to  the  doc....  it's  not  hn,  just  a  bad  case  of  hayfever...  benedryl  and  rest  for  me...
__label__0 "you  better  stop  wining,  pining,  get  your  dreams  in  line  and  just    shine,  design,  refine  until  they  come  true.  and  you�d  better  get  to  living"  -  *propname*
__label__0 "to  take  from  one  because  it  is  thought  that  his  own  industry  and  that  of  his  father's  has  acquired  too  much,  in  order  to  spare  to  others,  who,  or  whose  fathers  have  not  exercised  equal  industry  and  skill,  is  to  violate  arbitrarily  the  first  principle  of  association  --  the  guarantee  to  every  one  of  a  free  exercise  of  his  industry  and  the  fruits  acquired  by  it."~*propname*
__label__0 can't  breathe  out  of  either  one  of  my  "noses"  (as  my  sister  used  to  call  them)
__label__0 well  my  first  class  was  cancelled  because  the  professor  thinks  her  whole  family  has  come  down  with  hn,  so  i'm  trying  to  be  productive  anyway....
__label__0 class,  back  to  the  apt.  to  pack,  pickin'  up  a  few  necessities  at  bass  pro,  dentist,  then  home  for  the  weekend!!  :)
__label__0 also,  happy  xxrd  birthday  to  my  mama!
__label__0 oh  my  gee  willikers----i  do  not  like  writing  memos...
__label__0 so,  just  about  everyone  on  my  friend  list  is  highly  upset  that  it's  monday;  but  i  know  that  once  i  get  through  this  "-  in  class  +  homework  after  that"    monday,  my  week  is  nearly  over...  plus  home  on  thursday  for  fall  break!!!!    it's  going  to  be  a  great  week,  i  can  just  feel  it!
__label__0 was  astoundingly  productive  today...  chipping  away  is  a  lot  better  method  than  sitting  around  trying  to  figure  out  how  to  tackle  the  whole  mountain!
__label__0 life  is  way  too  short  and  way  too  good  to  stress  out  or  worry...  :)
__label__0 memo  is  over---  going  to  get  something  done  to  my  hair,  then  cleaning  the  apartment  and  going  out  with  *propname*  for  a  little  early  birthday  celebration!
__label__0 so  as  i  was  driving  to  school  this  morning,  belting  "my  baby  loves  me  just  the  way  that  i  am"  into  my  coffee  mug...  i  realized  for  the  th  time  this  week  just  how  much  i  love  life...    can't  wait  to  go  home  tomorrow  and  spend  lots  of  time  this  week  with  my  *propname*  and  my  family!
__label__0 c-span  is  unbelievable...  the  house  is  a  zoo  this  morning....    rep.  dingell  is  being  a  very  unfair  kindergarten  teacher  over  an  unruly  class...
__label__0 tuesday  is  here!!  home  after  my  property  class...  happy  birthday  to  my  meme  myrtle  (my  grandma)  who  is    years  old  today!!!  :)    she's  the  best  and  i'm  so  lucky  she's  my  grandma!
__label__0 cleaning  the  apartment...
__label__0 *propname*  and  *propname*'s  wedding  went  great!  i'm  so  happy  for  them!!!      wish  i  had  my  sd  card  earlier  so  i  could  have  taken  more  pics...    now,  in  richmond  and  back  to  the  real  world...  missin'  my  darlin'...
__label__0 ohh,  cleaning  then  reading  for  school...  all  the  while  just  thinking  about  how  much  i  can't  wait  to  go  home  on  thursday!    lots  of  time  with  my  one  and  only,  hunting,  and  all  the  fun  and  good  people  that  go  along  with  both!    can  not  wait.
__label__0 had  enough  of  this  memo  today,  almost  done!  reading  a  good  book  until  sleep...  can't  wait  until  home  on  tuesday...  it's  going  to  be  a  great  week!
__label__0 coffee,  christmas  cookies,  civil  procedure  and  christmas  movies...  :)
__label__0 back  in  richmond  after  a  great  thanksgiving  break...  missing  my  darlin'  already...    can't  wait  to  get  through  these  next    weeks  and  have  my  first  semester  of  law  school  behind  me...  :)
__label__0 so  good  to  be  home!    planning  to  get  a  few  things  accomplished  today  and  then  going  to  see  my  love  after  he  gets  off  work!
__label__0 back  in  richmond,  reading  for  classes  tomorrow  and  getting  ready  for  the  week..  can't  believe  i  only  have    full  weeks  of  classes  left  of  the  semester....
__label__0 oh  future  interests....  you  defeat  me.    professor  berryhill,  i  admit  that  you  are  god,  please  have  mercy  on  my  poor,  ignorant,  l  soul...
__label__0 is  wondering  why  her  attention  span  is  so  pitiful...  must...  pay...  attention...
__label__0 has  had  a  great  week  with  my  darlin'....  :)    it's  gone  by  way  too  fast...  now,  hunting  with  daddy  till  *propname*  gets  off  at  :...
__label__0 civ  pro  outlining  and  watching  the  pelican  brief...  and  before  you  think  "she  shouldn't  be  watching  a  movie"....  it's  a  movie  about  the  law  and  a  law  student,  it  definitely  qualifies  as  studying  in  my  book....  :)
__label__0 in  the  final    week  stretch!!
__label__0 snowing  in  richmond...
__label__0 so  i  really  have  a  final  tomorrow...  i  think  that's  finally  starting  to  set  in.
__label__0 studying  torts----missing  *propname*...
__label__0 property  midterm  =  over,    life  =  good,    me  =  packing  up,  dentists  appt.,  home.
__label__0 *propname*  and  i  have  successfully  added  a  new  trick  to  our  list...  playing  dead!    we're  excited!    :)    and  we  can't  wait  to  show  it  off  to  *propname*  when  he  gets  here!  <
__label__0 fried  taters  for  supper...  :)
__label__0 law  school...  you  are  not  too  much  fun  today...  december  th,  please  come  soon...
__label__0 *propname*  and  i  went  to  blockbuster  to  get  a  couple  movies...  we  both  said  we'd  been  wanting  to  see  four  christmases,  so  we  got  it...  turns  out  we  watched  it  together  last  year.  haha...    a  tradition  in  the  making?    teriyaki  pork  sirloin  and  stir  fry  for  dinner...  love  having  him  here  <
__label__0 so  *propname*  just  ate  the  end  of  my  highlighter...  i  think  that  means  she  wants  me  to  stop  studying...
__label__0 went  to  eat  some  mexican  food,  now  fixing  some  homemade  hot  cocoa  and  watching  movies  with  *propname*...  <
__label__0 so  i  decided  that  personally  thanking  everyone  for  the  birthday  wishes  was  probably  blowing  up  too  many  people's  news  feeds...  so  thanks  to  everyone!    <<<
__label__0 r.i.p.  orange  highlighter....  that  makes  the  score:  highlighters-;  *propname*-

__label__0 dear  god,  i  know  you've  got  a  lot  going  on  with  jesus'  birthday  coming  up  and  all,  but  i  need  you  to  take  this  civil  procedure  exam  for  me  in  the  morning.    i  know  you  take  all  of  my  exams  for  me,  but  i  really  need  ya  in  an  extra  special  sort  of  way  for  this  one.  oh  and    one  more  thing,  please  hold  off  the  snow  until  i  can  make  it  home....
__label__0 okay  so  why  am  i  here  going  through  a  long  day  of  classes  and  feeling  stressed  and  overwhelmed  instead  of  at  home  happily  hunting  with  my  love???    oh  yea,  i  want  to  finish  law  school  and  be  a  lawyer...  i  want  to  finish  law  school  and  be  a  lawyer...  just  have  to  keep  telling  myself  that.    haha.

__label__0 i  need  a  job
__label__0 is  checking  her  facebook  a  little  more  than  she  used  to...but  facebook  still  bombards  her  with  more  information  than  she  has  time  to  fool  with!    taking  things  at  a  glance.
__label__0 is  sick  as  a  dog  &  about  to  go  home  early...bluhhhh
__label__0 is  sick  of  the  pain.
__label__0 ...
__label__0 i  will  be  fine.    i've  gotten  through  everything  that  has  ever  been  thrown  at  me--nothing  can  keep  me  down  for  long.
__label__0 will  probably  be  taking  a  hiatus  from  facebook  again  for  a  bit...you  know  where  to  reach  me  if  you  wish  to  do  so!
__label__0 has  a  tummyache  (again,  stupid  tummy)  but  is  otherwise  alright!
__label__0 isn't  gonna  fool  with  facebook  applications,  but  does  check  facebook  briefly  every  day  now,  for  what  it's  worth...
__label__0 ...my  heart  hurts.
__label__0 is  somewhat  on  hiatus  from  facebook  for  a  while...may  check  it  occasionally...*shrug*
__label__0 is  very  well-rested,  lol.
__label__0 is  doin'  alright.  something  i've  come  to  realize:  you  can't  depend  on  anyone  all  the  time...but  almost  all  the  time  is  a  damn  good  percentage!
__label__0 is  so  glad  i  finally  tried  a  chiropractor!    my  back  hasn't  felt  this  good  in  ages!    i  was  very  crackly,  lol.
__label__0 is  still  pretty  much  on  facebook  hiatus...if  you  message  me  i'll  probably  answer  though.  otherwise,  most  of  you  know  where  to  find  me!
__label__0 is  relaxing...
__label__0 feeling  pretty  good  since  the  whole  'tweaking  my  outlook'  kick  i've  been  on...except  for  this  sore  throat//sniffles  thing,  geh.  but  i'll  live...hey,  drinking  tea  goes  along  with  the  zen  thing  anyway,  lol.
__label__0 is  determined  to  be  strong.
__label__0 feels  kinda  better  after  going  home  early  yesterday  &  resting...-hour  bug?    whatever  it  was  i'ma  try  to  take  it  easy  today  too.
__label__0 gonna  stay  late  at  work  to  get  some  extra  stuff  done,  &  then  go  home  &  veg  out.  i'm  a  geezer  today,  i  guess...
__label__0 i  mean  to  go  to  bed  early  (to  get  over  the  plague  of  atlanta),  and  yet  i  end  up  staying  up  all  night  doing  practically  nothing.    story  of  my  life.    hmph!
__label__0 bev  quote  of  the  hour:  "bah,  the  chaos  gods  can  suck  my  intangible  throbbing  member."
__label__0 doing  enough  work  to  compensate  for  being  in  atlanta  thursday  &  friday...blehhhh.    (still  at  work  at  frickin'  midnight!)    but  the  trip,  the  company  &  the  brief  respite  from  li  will  be  soooo  bloody  appreciated.
__label__0 am  engaged  in  battle  with  the  plague-beasts  of  atlanta.  *sneeze*    vitamins  make  good  ammo  in  such  altercations!
__label__0 yay  mythbusters!    ninjas,  explosions,  and  science,  oh  my!  :d  *nerdnerdnerd*
__label__0 this  morning  my  dad  said  "it  smells  weird  in  your  apartment."    found  the  culprit--something  in  my  dad's  house  upstairs  sprung  a  leak...right  through  my  bedroom  ceiling,  saturating  my  bedroom.    my  mattress,  lots  of  pillows,  some  expensive  clothes  and  some  beloved  posters  i  was  saving...are  all  ruined.    and  the  water's  still  leaking!    grrahhhh...
__label__0 musta  been,  i  dunno,  sleep-spelunking  or  somethin  last  night-cos  i  woke  up  with  a  fucked  up  knee.  i'ma  try  to  rest  this  wkend  &  rid  myself  of  the  mysterious  plague  of  atlanta  that  drained  me  all  week;  wish  there  was  a  cure  for  excessive  nihilism,  though.  *makes  face*
__label__0 ok...there  are  piles  of  "junk  that  isn't  supposed  to  be  on  my  desk"  that  keep  getting  bigger...while  the  things  that  are  supposed  to  live  on  my  desk  are  magically  disappearing.    what  fresh  hell  is  this?!
__label__0 the  mighty  boosh  is  completely  mad  but  completely  awesome.  it  has  soothed  my  disgruntled  sadness  with  its  peculiar  brand  of  british  inanity...and  interpretive  dance.  *nodnod*
__label__0 today's  sky  is  as  grey  as  my  default  mood  setting.    sometimes  it's  rather  exhausting  being  so  exquisitely  angst-ridden...*rolls  eyes,  sighs*
__label__0 gah...sick  of  feeling  like  crap!  gods  deliver  me  from  resilient  falltime  ailments...*brandishes  stick  menacingly...then  gets  dizzy  and  passes  out*

__label__0 feelin'  pretty  lousy  today...basically  zombie-ing  through  work,  and  not  in  the  fun  way.    i  feel  like  part  of  my  brain  is  missing  and  has  been  replaced  by  canned  air.    bleah...monday  is  definitely  my  least  favorite  day!

__label__0 god  damn  it...i  need  for  my  laptop  to  not  freeze  for    minutes  before  deciding  to  perhaps  or  perhaps  not  perform  the  command  i've  clicked...i  need  a  car  that  isn't  a  fucking  pretzel,  or  at  least  some  form  of  viable  transportation...i  need  add  meds  that  don't  leave  me  staring  off  into  fucking  space  at  work...gahhh!    very  fucking  frustrated!    anyone  with  input  re  laptop  or  car,  please  comment...*sigh*
__label__0 it's  insane  how  much  time  one  has  to  spend  on  the  telephone  with  basically  everyone  in  christendom  after  a  big  car  accident...blahhhh...deliver  me  from  being  on  hold  all  day!  *glares  at  phone*
__label__0 meh.    humans  are  a  fickle  species.
__label__0 about  to  go  to  bed  so  i  can  get  up  early  to  check  out  a  car  tomorrow  morn...*crosses  fingers*  hope  this  one  pans  out;  the  longer  i'm  trapped,  vehicleless,  the  more  likely  i  am  to  go  completely  bloody  mad!
__label__0 it's  a  dk  kind  of  day.  *nod*
__label__0 "*propname*  could  never  have  superman's  baby.  do  you  think  her  fallopian  tubes  could  handle  the  sperm?  i  guarantee  he  blows  a  load  like  a  shotgun  right  through  her  back...the  only  way  he  could  bang  regular  chicks  is  with  a  kryptonite  condom...but  that  would  kill  him!"
__label__0 unproductive  day...home  sick  &  made  no  money,  and  no  progress  carwise...but  at  least  i  got  some  rest,  i  guess.  *sigh*
__label__0 went  and  got  the  last  of  my  stuff  out  of  my...car...(read:  twisted  metal  heap  with  fuzzy  seats)  this  morning.    it  was  kind  of  sad...i  apologized  to  car  (yeah,  that's  its  name  dammit,  shut  up)  for  smushing  it,  and  hugged  it  goodbye,  and  then  took  the  title  to  my  mechanic  so  it  can  be  junked.    thusly,  the  day  started  in  kind  of  a  somber  mood.    if  only  i  could  locate  a  sufficient  replacement,  though...
__label__0 well,  going  to  bed  with  a  smile  on  my  face.    nice  change  from  the  rest  of  the  week!  haha...somehow  my  facebook  got  switched  to  german  for  awhile...it  was  ok,  'cause  i  could  read  most  of  the  german--just  rather  random!    this  box  asked  me  "was  machts  du  gerade"  for  half  the  night...lol.    actually  i  might  switch  it  back  to  german  and  leave  it  for  awhile--it  amuses  me!  :p
__label__0 soooo  frickin'  psyched  for  atlanta.    getting  the  fuck  outta  li,  seeing  my  superawesome  folks,  finally  getting  some  proper  southern  food,  and  maybe  even  checking  out  decatur  nightlife  &  williams  street...the  word  of  the  day  is  "yaaayyyyy!"

__label__0 bah!  humbug!  in  other  news,  i  really  wanna  see  ninja  assassin!  in  other  news...eh,  don't  matter  anyway,  nevermind.
__label__0 car  search  =driving  me  mad!  no  jetpacks  on  ebay  (i  checked)  so  that's  out.  rollerblading'd  surely  break  my  ass.  motorcycle=me  smeared  across  the  pavement.  mopeds  are...small.  no  horse  handy  or  i  could  amish  it  up  w//  a  little  cart!  bikeseats  hurt  my  delicate  posterior.  boats  don't  travel  well  on  land.  don't  think  segways  go  fast  enough  to  get  anywhere-i'd  probably  fall  off  anyway.  hurry  up  &  invent  transporters!!
__label__0 having  a  mixed  day:  got  less  than    hour  of  sleep  (and  even  that  was  interrupted  sleep!),  so  i'm  kinda  white-knuckling  it  through  the  workday  a  bit...but  also  got  the  car  'legal'  at  the  dmv--and  it  only  took  like    minutes!    well,  at  least  i'm  too  tired  to  think  myself  into  a  funk  again!
__label__0 i  just  saw  an...interesting...car  commercial.  according  to  said  commercial,  apparently  "twilight's  *propname*"  drives...a  volvo.  a  volvo.  a  vampire...in  a  volvo.*  wow...i  didn't  think  that  that  character  could  get  any  lamer;  i  was  wrong!    *no  offense  to  volvo  owners,  the  cars  are  fine...but  'mister  (supposedly)  superawesome  vampire'  driving  one?  lol.
__label__0 is  now  friends  with  i  need  a  fucking  car!!!
__label__0 i  gotta  ask:  why  pirates  or  ninjas?    why  not  both?    also,  two  interesting  concepts  i've  recently  discovered:  horror  cakes  competition  on  food  network  tomorrow  (one  of  them  bleeds  when  you  cut  the  cake!  awesome!)...and  a  children's  book  series  i  saw  in  the  bookstore  recently,  called  vampirates...i  dig  the  name,  and  the  concept...not  sure  about  the  execution  though.    still...intriguing!
__label__0 feeling  quite  content,  in  spite  of  all  that  'ails'  me.  *quirks  lips  into  a  serene  smile*
__label__0 "hope  in  reality  is  the  worst  of  all  evils  because  it  prolongs  the  torment  of  man."--friedrich  nietzsche  ----------------------------------------  yeah,  fuck  hope.    let's  try  action!    control  what  you  can  control.    determination  burns  within  me  again.
__label__0 tired  of  introspection  tonight;  it  leaves  me...bereft...and  the  silence  screams  madly  in  my  ears.
__label__0 finally  got  a  car!    nissan  altima  gxe  w//  ,  miles  on  it  in  pretty  good  shape.  mechanics  aside,  glad  i  have  a  car  w//  a  stereo  again.  don't  like  that  it's  white,  but  i  took  what  i  could  get!  might  either  mural-paint  or  shop-repaint  it  if  it  annoys  me  enough.    also  had  a  really  great  weekend  (thank  you,  guys.  xoxo!)--nice  change  from  the  last  few!  glad  as  hell  i'm  not  stranded  anymore!!
__label__0 is  freezing!    not  feeling  very  good,  either.    hope  it's  a  'passing  fancy'  and  not  an  ailment!
__label__0 happy  halloween  all!  stuck  @  home  recuperating  from  totaling  my  fuckin  car  yestermorn-they're  right,  it  does  hurt  more  the  day  after-but  "i'm  not  dead  yet!!"  great  time  last  night  tho-celebrating  living.  thanx  to  all  who  made  it  possible  &  who  made  it  awesome!  yay  dethklok  show,  asylum,  &  some  fucking  wonderful  humans,  including  my  rockin'  friends  &  lotsa  cool  folks  i  met  last  night.  *hugs  the  world,  retreats  to  bed*
__label__0 i'm  back  from  atlanta,  over    hours  after  i  was  s'posed  to  be...am  worn  the  fuck  out.    but  had  a  great  fuckin'  time  down  there  before  the  airtravel  assraping!    so,  yay  to  that!  ;d
__label__0 urgent!!    does  anyone  want  to  see  sonic  youth  with  dinosaur  jr.  tonight  at  terminal    in  manhattan  (show  starts    pm)??    sean  is  sick  and  can't  go  so  i  have  a  free  ticket  to  the  show,  which  is  sold  out  otherwise.    if  you're  interested,  drop  me  a  text!!  --.
__label__0 sweet  respite...  *snooze*
__label__0 waking  from  a  really  good  dream  into  harsh  reality  is  one  of  the  great  cruelties  of  life.    *groggy  and  disgruntled*
__label__0 ...and  now  back  to  my  regularly  scheduled  severe  dangerously-nihilistic  depression.  :d!!!!!!!!!!!one!
__label__0 bored  with  cartoons  &  porn...time  to  sleep  i  guess.  *blink,  shrug,  yawn*
__label__0 it  just  occurred  to  me  that  two  of  my  favorite  songs  are  punk  songs  about  gruesome  abortions  ("bodies"  by  sex  pistols  and  "die  of  shame"  by  tilt)...man,  i'm  just  not  quite  right,  lol!
__label__0 "just  another  manic  monday"...nah,  not  really--if  i  was  manic  right  now  i'd  probably  be  getting  alot  more  done,  lol!
__label__0 intelligence  is  a  curse,  life  a  senseless  disease.    gods  grant  me  respite  by  death  or  lobotomy...
__label__0 my,  how  the  randomness  abounds!...but  i  need  some  sleep.
__label__0 heh...:"god  i  wish  that  i  could  hide  away//and  find  a  wall  to  bang  my  brains//i'm  living  in  a  fantasy,//a  nightmare  dream...reality//people  ride  about  all  day//in  metal  boxes  made  away//i  wish  that  they  would  drop  the  bomb//and  kill  these  cunts//that  don't  belong!  i  hate  people!//i  hate  the  human  race//i  hate  people!//i  hate  your  ugly  face//i  hate  people!//i  hate  your  fucking  mess//i  hate  people!//they  hate  me!"-anti-nowhere  league
__label__0 my  foot  is  asleep...maybe  it's  trying  to  tell  me  i  should  be  asleep,  too...*conks*
__label__0 today's  stream  of  consciousness:  hooray  for  comic  books,  poetry  and  nerds  in  general...forgot  my  phone  at  home  today,  blargh  (couldn't  reach  me,  that's  why)...swamped  at  work...pretzels  suck...missing  nola  (especially  the  quarter)  alot  today  for  some  reason..."the  holidays"  are  annoying  me  already...wikipedia  is  addictive...so  is  facebook,  gods  help  me...!
__label__0 holy  shit,  the  sky  is  falling:  my  dad  actually  cheered  me  up  out  of  a  tough  spot  for  once!    maybe  he's  learning!    or  maybe  it  was  a  fluke...either  way,  i  feel  a  lot  better  now!    :)    dammit  someone  find  me  a  good  yoga  studio  now,  lol!
__label__0 meh.  bleh.  feh!!
__label__0 my  body  may  be  a  medical  nightmare,  but  at  least  it  leaves  me  hangover-free  for  some  reason,  hah!    glad  to  see  everyone  last  night...thanks  all  for  the  *loves*  and  for  those  who  were  kind  in  the  face  of  my  drunken  overhonesty,  oy.
__label__0 never  enough
__label__0 needs  a  change.  anyone  know  any  yoga  studios  in  or  close  to  the  smithtown//kings  park  area?  gotta  find  my  zen  again!
__label__0 sunday  bloody  sunday...booooring...!
__label__0 just  had  a  -minute  conversation  w//  my  dad  about  midget  porn.    sometimes  he  ain't  half  bad,  lol...
__label__0 it's  amazing  what  you'll  watch  on  tv  when  you  stay  up  all  night.
__label__0 "yes  yes  yes,  effervescently  meaningless..."
__label__0 getting  another  potential  car  checked  out  by  my  mechanic  tomorrow...god  i  hope  one  of  these  fucking  things  works  out  soon!  *blows  up  apartment*
__label__0 what's  black  and  green  and  red  all  over?    me  after  the  gwar  show,  yeah!  xd    time  for  the  sleep  of  a  lifetime  now,  though...damn.
__label__0 getting  out  of  the  house,  yay!    going  with  'anon'  (lol)  to  eat  curry  and  hang  out  with  folks  or  someodd.    man,  anywhere's  better  than  being  stuck  at  my  stupid  apartment!
__label__0 sick  of  this  nihilistic  depression  shit--fine,  life  may  be  meaningless,  i  may  be  right  about  all  the  other  disturbingly  bleak  shit  i've  been  thinking...but  i'm  not  a  self-killer  so  i'm  stuck  here--might  as  well  pull  it  together  and  live  this  crazy  life  i've  got  anyway,  eh?    some  change  is  in  the  works  (just  in  time  for  the  new  year,  ironically).
__label__0 yes,  i  have  no  bananas...i  have  no  bananas  todayyyyy!
__label__0 going  upstairs  to  beg  my  dad  for  some  of  the  wonderful-smelling  eggplant  parm  they  just  made!  *crosses  fingers*  no  food  down  here.  :(
__label__0 me  da  is  my  hero  right  now...he  found  me  some  fucking  nyquil!!      hours  awake  is  waaaay  more  than  enough  (especially  when  i'm  sick).    going  to  go  smoke  with  the  ghost  in  the  back  of  my  head  (heyy,  random  little-remembered  song  reference!).    goodnight  folks!!
__label__0 went  to  the  latest  disney  cartoon  with  my  dad  tonight...it  was  set  in  new  orleans  and  it  was  surprisingly  pretty  good.  but  it  made  me  miss  my  nola  soo  much...as  i  told  my  dad,  i'm  sure  i'll  end  up  back  home  someday,  but  for  now  i  need  to  be  here.  sigh!      in  other  news,  my  cold  is  getting  worse,  blech.  trying  everything  i  can  to  get  rid  of  it  quickly!
__label__0 i  gotta  admit...powerpuff  girls  cracks  me  up!  :p    yeah,  shush.  in  other  news...fuck  i'm  freezin'  me  arse  off!
__label__0 if  i'm  stuck  in  the  house  long  enough,  maybe  i'll  clean  it!    that's  looking  on  the  bright  side  i  guess...at  least  i'm  in  a  better  mood  and  a  little  less  ill  than  yesterday,  though  maybe  a  little  stir  crazy--i  found  myself  dancing  to  the  baskin  *propname*  'ice  cream  and  cake'  commercial,  lol!
__label__0 ugh...headache  and  some  amount  of  nervousness.    resurrection  tomorrow  night  though,  yay!    night  all...
__label__0 holy  sinus  headache,  batman!  *left  eyeball,  unable  to  take  the  'pressure,'  explodes  out  of  skull,  shoots  across  room,  lands  in  file  drawer  under  "o"  for  "owwww"*
__label__0 tis  the  season  to  cough  up  weird  stuff...yecch.
__label__0 can't  sleep--landmines  in  my  mind.    awake  since    am,  ugh...
__label__0 happy  thingy,  people...
__label__0 ok...broken  snow  shovel,  and  the  plow  bastard  we  called  is    hours  late.    don't  mind  too  much  that  i'm  missing  work,  but  i  do  mind  that  i  have  no  food  in  the  house  and  wanted  to  go  buy  some  fucking  food!    that  plow  motherfucker  will  be  getting  my  spaceboot  up  his  plowtastic  ass!    as  long  as  i  don't  pass  out  from  starvation  first,  hmph.
__label__0 had  bad  dreams  last  night,  some  sobering  thoughts  on  my  mind...yet  i'm  still  in  a  good  mood  today.    i  don't  get  it,  but  i'm  not  complaining!
__label__0 sad  &  depressed  as  hell,  but  rocking  the  living  fuck  out...weird  combination.
__label__0 supposedly  hauppauge  means  "land  of  sweet  water."    somehow  i  doubt  the  water's  very  "sweet"  anymore,  considering  that  hauppauge  is  now  an  industrial  district...
__label__0 dear  santa:    i  know  i'm  a  grinch,  but  could  you  please  bring  me  a  computer  repairman  for  christmas?    i'll  make  you  jambalaya...

__label__0 my  car  no  longer  screeches  like  a  banshee  passing  kidney  stones...thanks,  mr.  mechanic!    in  other  news,  my  'simple'  cold  is  worsening  by  the  hour  and  i'm  feverish...and  all  of  the  home  remedies  and  cold  meds  i  try  are  for  naught!    bah!
__label__0 well  that  was  entertaining...got  some  of  my  dad's  eggplant  parm,  but  was  treated  to  watching  him,  completely  sloshed,  watch  the  wizard  of  oz  and  caterwaul  all  the  words  with  both  *propname*  and  the  wicked  witch.  he  says  the  wizard  is  a  prick,  by  the  way.    and,  "look!  look,  bev,  they  dropped  a  fuckin'  house  on  her!!"
__label__0 sorry  i  had  to  bail  so  early  on  sanctuary  last  night,  folks...sick  &  tired  does  not  a  fun  bev  make--sittin'  in  the  corner  like  ol'  granny  watchin'  the  kiddies  play  outside!  *scrunches  nose*
__label__0 i'm  so  pleased  today  i  might  start  glowing!  xd  ...hopefully  more  in  a  pleasant  way  than  a  radioactive  way.    a  new  year  is  directly  impending,  yay!!    ecstatic  for  a  symbolic  fresh  start//  season  of  change,  let  me  tell  you!
__label__0 momentarily  considered  waxing  poetic  about  the  new  year  (one  'holiday'  that  is  actually  somewhat  important  to  me),  but  it's  all  been  said  before,  i'm  sure.    instead,  i'm  just  gonna  go  get  loads  of  sleep  so  i  can  enjoy  tomorrow  night's  festivities  wholeheartedly!
__label__0 second  half  of  last  week  quite  sucked  and  was  uneventful  to  boot...may  this  week  be  an  improvement!    *kicks  suckiness  repeatedly  with  pointy!pointy!shoes*
__label__0 dammit  dammit  i  can't  sleep!    awake  all  night  then  tried  to  fall  asleep  for    hours.    at  least  if  i  had  hypothermia  i'd  fall  unconscious...hmm.    but  that  would  require  going  outside...or,  more  importantly,  moving.    fuck  that  noise!
__label__0 hoping  this  insane  wind  doesn't  blow  me  away  to  oz...those  munchkins  might've  gone  feral  by  now.  *shudder*
__label__0 i  lahk  the  cut  o'  yerr  jib...*licks  teeth  creepily*
__label__0 well...if  my  interactions  and  happenings  of  last  night  were  any  indication,    may  well  be  a  pretty  good  year...but  we'll  see!    happy  new  year,  love  y'all!  :d
__label__0 is  currently  being  a  disgruntled  employee...grrr.  *brandishes  fist  ineffectually*
__label__0 eh,  why  the  hell  not:    this  should  be  interesting.  lets  see  how  honest  my  fb  friends  are.  leave  a    word  comment  that  you  think  best  describes  me.  it  can  only  be    word.  no  more  than    word.  then  copy  &  paste  this  post  on  your  wall  so  i  can  leave  a  word  about  you.  wonder  how  many  brave  friends  will  do  this.
__label__0 busybusybusy!  :d  out  &  about  is  much  better  than  in  and  bored!
__label__0 -wise,  so  far,  so  good!    feeling  pretty  bloody  fantastic  compared  to  my  emotional  state  of  the  last  few  months.    i've  even  been  somewhat  productive  recently.    however,  i  am  going  home  now;  my  desk  chair  has  made  my  ass  numb!    (how  does  one  wake  up  a  sleeping  ass,  haha?    i'll  probably  be  sorry  i  asked...)
__label__0 sick  as  a  dog  and  hoping  it  doesn't  snow  too  much.
__label__0 my  mind  feels  like  a  murder-suicide.    i  hate  this  life  so  much  it  hurts...and  it  hurts  so  much  i've  been  rendered  numb.
__label__0 re-conditioning  my  hands  back  into  top  gaming  form--i  used  to  be  able  to  go  all  day  (or  for  days)  without  a  break  (even  to  eat  or  go  to  the  bathroom,  lol...toldja  i  was  obsessed!);  currently  my  thumbs  start  to  hurt  after  about    hours.    that's  what  i  get  for  being  outta  practice,  bah!
__label__0 *sneeze,  cough,  snort*  blech!    trying  that  airborne  shit  tonight!    at  least  i'm  getting  the  screechy  car  fixed  today.    now  if  i  could  only  find  gloves  that  match  eachother...*wearing  one  black  leather  glove  and  one  knit  blue  striped  glove*
__label__0 "is  it  special  when  you're  lonely//  do  you  spend  your  whole  life//  in  a  studio  apartment//  with  a  cat  for  a  wife//  the  seasons,  when  they  call  you//  do  you  barricade  the  door//  are  you  stubborn,  stubborn,  stubborn  to  the  core?...then  the  longest  winter//  is  on  her  way//  you  called  her  without  knowing  it//  but  now  it's  too  late..."  trying  to  keep  the  zen,  but  it's  hard  to  hang  onto  sometimes  on  nights  like  these.
__label__0 cold  weather  can  bite  me,  and  so  can  christmas.    *sticks  out  tongue*    i'm  doin'  reasonably  alright  today  but  ehhhhh...got  a  'eadache  from  'ell.
__label__0 *sigh*
__label__0 oi!!!
__label__0 feeling  damn  good  headwise  lately:  forceful  self-change  of  outlook,  meds  seem  to  be  finally  working,  &  i'm  startin  to  get  shit  done!  'course,  meds  need  tweaking--one  of  'em  (dunno  which)  is  also  tryin  to  make  me  a  zombie--not  the  fun  movie  kind,  either:  i  get  sleepy  around    or    pm  now;  too  damn  early  even  if  i  weren't  a  night  owl!  psyched  bout  the  forward  progress,  but  this  zombie  thing's  crampin'  my  nightlife,  oy!
__label__0 sick  as  a  dog  and  wishing  my  heat  worked  better.  hoping  for  as  little  snow  as  possible,  under  these  circumstances!
__label__0 hates  crying,  hates  her  health  (or  lack  thereof),  hates  snow,  and  hates  christmas  and  its  trappings  of  tomfoolery.    today  has  become  a  day  of  hate.  *angry  pout*
__label__0 *rootin'  around  for  'retro'  bev  pics*
__label__0 meow  meow  tiiiiiredddd  meow  meow.  *pokes  work  with  stick*
__label__0 hopin'  i'll  sleep  tonight!  went  from  one  extreme  to  the  other--sleeping  all  the  time  to  not  sleeping  at  all.  what  an  unpleasant  adventure  this  is  being!
__label__0 surreal  night...i  think  i  might've  slept  and  just  woke  up  every  hour  and  lay  awake  for  awhile  before  falling  back  asleep  again--but  conversely,  i  might've  just  lain  awake  and  semi-insensible  the  whole  night  with  periods  of  more  awareness...not  sure  which!    either  way,  i'm  tired,  but  surprisingly  decent  otherwise!
__label__0 well,  lived  through  the  carbon  monoxide  shit,  though  it  made  me  sick  today--luckily  not  sick  enough  to  go  to  the  damn  hospital  i  guess;  just  sick  enough  to  be  puking  and  bedridden  today.  good  thing  i  had  the  day  off  anyway  for  mlk  day  (but  my  dad  didn't  tell  me  that,  so  i  woke  up  ill  and  panicky  this  afternoon--nice,  lol).  furnace  was  fixed  today,  though,  so  no  more  cm  troubles,  i  suppose!
__label__0 wheeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!!!    (she  says  as  she  continues  to  be  nerdy  on  her  couch.  :p)    veggin'  can  be  good  when  you're  having  sillyfuntime!  :d    ...takin'  a  vote  though:  after  cartoons,  shall  i  play  arcadey  fighters,  rpgs,  or  go  old-school?    narrowed  it  down  that  far,  but...so  hard  to  choose  hehe!
__label__0 have  good  weekend,  meine  leibschen,  yes  yes!    i  kiss  you,  muah!    (me,  hausfrau?!    nein,  nein!!!)
__label__0 ehh...bite  me!
__label__0 "some  of  the  shows  on  mtv  are  not  my  cup  of  tea...mainly  because  i  don't  like  huge  pieces  of  shit  in  my  tea!"
__label__0 doesn't  get  it--even  when  i  get  enough  sleep,  i  run  out  of  energy  long  before  the  day  is  over...what  gives?!    this  rampant  exhaustion  really  puts  a  cramp  on  my  life  &  times...and  now  i'm  gonna  go  sleep  some  more.    hmph!
__label__0 *sigh*
__label__0 i  try  to  keep  my  health  complaints  to  others  to  a  minimum  these  days,  but...well,  let's  just  say  fuck.    sometimes  i  feel  like  being  such  a  survivor  is  goddamned  overrated.
__label__0 sleepytime  at  last!    bundled  up  in  blankets  like  fuckin'  jesus  inna  manger.    or  medieval  couples  that  weren't  sposed  to  fuck  yet,  lol.    fuck  off,  snow!
__label__0 so  very  frustrated...&  kinda  sad.  and  so  fucking  sleepy...god  damn  these  meds,  i'm  sleeping  my  life  away.
__label__0 mehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhurrrrrghhhhhhhh.....
__label__0 is  ok  now.
__label__0 why  do  i  insist  on  eating  popsicles  in  winter?    om  nom  nom
__label__0 the  cleaner  my  apartment  gets,  the  more  of  my  hobbies  i  get  back  into  (partially  because  i  can  find  my  stuff  again,  lol!)...yayyy!    first  one  to  return:  gaming.    i  might  not  get  back  to  the  rest  of  those  erstwhile  hobbies  for  awhile,  though--i  tend  to  get  quiiite  obsessive  about  my  vidya  games,  hehe...
__label__0 it  liiiives!!!    (meds  adjusted--we'll  see  if  i  stay  awake  today!  *blinkblink*)
__label__0 *shrug*  eh.
__label__0 is  trying  not  to  be  grumpy.
__label__0 ok  lady  i  love  you  buh-bye!  *finally  leaves  house*
__label__0 off  to  prepare  for  a  night  of  festivitation...  here  we  come,  haharr!
__label__0 getting  ready  for  ma  belle  *propname*'s  birthday  whatnottery...may  i  not  fall  asleep  face-down  in  cake  this  evening!*crosses  fingers*
__label__0 hangin'  with  *propname*...stay  awake,  stay  awake!  *pokes  self  with  fork*
__label__0 dear  car  battery:  why  are  you  dead  again?    what  am  i  going  to  do  with  you??  (no,  really--what  am  i  supposed  to  do  with  it?)    you  make  me  sad.  ://
__label__0 hmm...it's  hard  to  play  'find  the  smell'  in  your  apartment  when  it's  so  cold  that  sniffing  the  air  hurts!    but  why  the  fuck  does  my  place  smell  like  a  lawnmower  anyway?!
__label__0 frisky  dingo  makes  my  chest  hurt...with  laughing!  i  need  to  get  season    stat.  damn,  i  would  pillage  for  some  bourbon  chicken  right  now!  glad  *propname*  is  finally  back  in  town...good  times  man!  :d
__label__0 taken  off  the  troublesome  med!  back  to  bev  as  usual  now  i  guess.
__label__0 brrr!    "stiff  little  fingers"  indeed!
__label__0 doesn't  know  what  to  think.
__label__0 upon  taking  a  brief  hiatus  from  facebook--holy  shit,  too  many  updates  to  read!  *mind  boggles*
__label__0 just  remembered  a  tv  ad  from  her  childhood  in  the  'glorious'  south:  horribly  fat,  hideous  angels  with  big  ol'  hair,  tammy-faye-esque  makeup,  and  (of  course)  heavy  southern  accents  hollering  "don't  you  buy  no  uug-ly  truuck!"  cracked  me  up  then,  cracks  me  up  now,  haha!
__label__0 meow?
__label__0 too  lazy  to  scan  'retro'  pics  right  now--fuck  it,  maybe  later.  i  notice  that  i  pretty  much  look  the  same  as  i  have  for  the  past  ~  years  (kinda  freaky!!)...thus,  it's  hard  to  tell  what  year  a  photo  is  from.  oddly  enough,  my  skin  was  better  when  i  was  a  teenager  than  it  is  now!
__label__0 black.
__label__0 well,  meds  situation  is  not  ideal  by  any  means  (zombieish  again)  but  it's  a  vast  improvement  on  the  last  few  days  of  horror!
__label__0 i  think  i've  finally  found  the  right  med...this  must  be  what  normal  people  feel  like!
__label__0 i  feel  pretty  spiffy  today--befuddling  my  dad  with  random  comments,  doin'  my  weird  acrobatics  and  dances,  singin'  wordless  nonsense  songs...alot  better  than  medicated  zombie  bev  (though  admittedly  alot  more  absurd,  lol)!    sure  spices  up  the  office  though  haha--as  long  as  i  don't  careen  into  the  conference  table!    :d
__label__0 fucking  carbon  monoxide  alarm's  going  off  repeatedly  again  tonight!  opened  the  windows  &  garage  doors;  i  have  nowhere  else  i  can  go  &  i  need  sleep,  so  i'm  gonna  hafta  just  hope  the  ventilation  is  enough  cos  i  don't  know  what  else  to  do.  hope  i  don't  end  up  in  the  hospital  over  this  shit--i'm  sick  of  the  damn  hospital!  (well...bein'  dead  would  [debatably]  suck  too.  but  i  wouldn't  be  self-aware  to  know  about  it,  lol.)
__label__0 has  been  too  busy  living  life  to  spend  much  time  on  facebook  this  week--just  the  way  i  like  it!  :d
__label__0 whew.
__label__0 got  to  be  'early  to  rise'  tomorrow,  so  i'ma  try  to  be  'early  to  bed'  tonight...thusly,  going  to  bed  now;  we'll  see  how  that  goes!
__label__0 is  amused  at  the  universe  today.  *cracks  up*
__label__0 hm...started  the  day  out  feeling  ok,  but  now  i  feel  like  three-week-old  leftovers  molding  in  the  back  of  a  broken  fridge  in  hell...yes,  a  hell-fridge.  guess  work  doesn't  agree  with  me!
__label__0 been  trying  to  catch  up  on  sleep  since  i  pretty  much  hadn't  slept  in    days...woken  up  by  the  carbon  monoxide  alarm,  and  it's  the  real  deal.    my  dad  opened  the  window  by  the  furnace  and  my  living  room  window  and  went  back  to  bed,  nice.    hmm...gonna  go  back  to  sleep  if  possible  and  hope  halfheartedly  that  i'm  still  alive  in  the  morning.

()  make  sure  to  have  booked  everything  before  you  need  it  so  you  don't  end  up  getting  stuck  in  one  place  longer  than  you  wanted.    and  i  think  i  may  know  why  my  card  didn't  work  yesterday...  gonna  try  it  out  tomorrow  if  i  can.
__label__1 *is  in  brunei  without  a  mobile  containing  international  roaming*  stupid  people  who  i  asked  to  set  it  up  for  me  months  and  months  ago...  maybe  it's  just  in  the  airport  though...  hope  so.

__label__1 is  serverely  disappointed  about  what  he  just  learnt.

__label__1 i  am  being  called  to  be  a  man  of  the  cloth.  but  is  that  what  i  will  be  happy  doing?  god  or  the  girl?
__label__1 "make  sure  your  seat-backs  and  trays  are  in  their  up-right  and  lock  positions  and  thank  you  for  flying  american  airlines.  flight  attendants...prepare  for  take  off."

__label__1 give  a  man  a  fish,  and  you'll  feed  him  for  a  day;  give  him  a  religion,  and  he'll  starve  to  death  while  praying  for  a  fish.  ~author  unknown
__label__1 can  i  possibly  love  her?
__label__1 we  remember...we  believe.  have  you  forgotten  how  you  felt  that  day,  when  your  homeland  was  under  fire,  and  your  people  blown  away?  ...in  a  crowded  room  do  you  feel  alone?  faith,  hope,  and  love,  are  some  good  thing  he  gave  us,  but  the  greatest  is  love.
__label__1 sometime  the  military  [air  force]  isn't  really  smart  about  money.
__label__1 god  is  more  interested  in  what  we  are  than  what  we  do.  that's  why  we're  called  human  beings,  not  human  doings.  ~thanks  vocation  boom
__label__1 "cheese  is  the  devil's  plaything."
__label__1 why  do  we  give  people  titles  because  of  what  they  do  and  not  who  they  are?  this  is  what  bothers  me,  but  maybe  i'm  just  waiting  for  a  world  that  sees  people  not  for  what  they  do  but  who  they  are.
__label__1 just  played  and  sang  a  buch  of  chirstmas  music  for  a  general  of  the  united  sates  air  force's  reception.  there  were  so  many  "big-wigs"  there  and  it  was  a  blast.  not  to  mention  there  was  a  cute  girl  bartending...great  night.
__label__1 the  monastery  of  our  lady  of  the  holy  spirit  in  conyers,  georgia  was  so  beautiful.  there  is  nothing  like  waking  up  at    o'clock  for  vigils,  a  morning  prayer  prayed  in  the  liturgy  of  the  hours.  then  have  lauds  mixed  with  mass...beautiful!

__label__1 we  have  seen  them  wear  purple  for  four  sundays,  maybe  even  rose  for  one  of  those  sundays.  we  have  prepared  our  heart,  mind,  and  soul.  we  now  await  for  his  coming...  "o  emmanuel,  king  and  lawgiver,  desire  of  the  nations,  savior  of  all  people,  come  and  set  us  free,  lord  our  god."

"seeing  the  star,  the  wise  men  said:  this  must  signify  the  birth  of  some  great  king.  let  us  search  for  him  and  lay  treasures  at  his  feet:  gold,  frankincense,  and  myrrh."

__label__1 found  red  bean  paste  in  her  chocolate  croissant  this  morning,  and  reluctantly  switched  her  inner  monologue  from  french  back  to  chinese.
__label__1 struggles  to  say  that  she's  taking  a  class  on  "networking"  with  a  straight  face.
__label__1 is  energized  by  super  last  minute  flights,  and  very  grateful  to  *propname*'s  mother.
__label__1 is  enchanted  by  this  website  (http:////www.inbflat.net//),  even  if  her  chinese  internet  can't  load  fast  enough  to  properly  display  the  videos.
__label__1 got  six  pairs  of  shoes  for  christmas.    it  might  officially  be  time  for  her  to  stop  wearing  her  much  loved  cirque  du  soleil  flip-flops.
__label__1 just  finished  a  christopher  lin-induced  snes  binge.    donkey  kong  country:  complete.    aladdin:  lamentably  ongoing.    there's  a  party  here  in  agrabah,  if  you  care  to  revitalize  her  arabian  efforts.

__label__1 is  glad  that  he  caught  a  bit  of  "*propname*'s  drag  race"  last  night.    *propname*  stepped  it  up  a  notch  with  the  show  setting  and  hair//makeup.    the  competition  is  fiercer  than  ever...it  reminds  him  of  the  transition  "america's  next  top  model"  from  cycle    to  cycle  .    he's  feelin  "totes  reality"  right  now.

__label__0 "i'm  sorry,  i'm  about  to  lose  you  because  i'm  about  to  drive  into  a  tunnel  in  a  canyon  on  an  airplane  while  hanging  up  the  phone."  -  house
__label__0 is  sad  that  he  missed  out  on  fun  to  go  work  for  ~+  hours
__label__0 it  will  be  hot  for  the  next  few  days,  but  it  looks  like  we  should  be  getting  a  denser  cloud  of  percipitation  coming  over  san  diego  soon  which  should  help  cool  things  down  a  few  degrees.  but  don't  hold  me  to  it  i'm  not  an  actually  meterologist  so  my  interpertation  of  the  satalite  imagery  might  be  off  a  little.
__label__0 thinks  that  sleep  is  a  good  idea  and  who  ever  invented  sleep  deserves  a  cookie.  a  big  cookie.  with  chocolate  chips.  fresh  from  the  oven.  back  to  my  point,  sleep  =  good.
__label__0 first  day  of  school  =  tired  +  scared  for  when  real  work  comes.
__label__0 is  amazing  of  course,  and  the  apples  to  apples  champion.
__label__0 never  relized  how  tiring  it  is  to  be  social  for  exstended  periods  of  time.
__label__0 is  watching  reruns  of  house  on  hulu.  house  rocks,  and  when  he  comes  back  in  two  weeks  we  will  see  how  much  worse  the  crazy  people  are  when  house  goes  at  them.
__label__0 is  excited  that  he  was  able  to  perdict  the  weather  by  properly  interperting  satilite  imagery!!
__label__0 wins!  take  that  malmal
__label__0 is  going  to  be  full  of  himself  for  no  real  reason  for  the  next  couple  of  hours.  he  also  made  really  good  chocolate  chip  cookies,  from  scratch  by  hand.
__label__0 just  got  a  shot  in  his  ass  for  his  headache,  that  works  like  how  he  imagines  works  like  vicodin  for  house's  leg.  minus  the  addictive  part  that  is.  basicly  *propname*  is  in  a  good  mood  now  that  he  isn't  in  pain.
__label__0 i  have  my  car  back!!  *does  happy  dance*  no  one  witnessed  that.
__label__0 is  praying  for  a  phone  call  from  the  doctors  saying  the  neurologist  accepted  his  referal  and  will  see  him  soon.
__label__0 was  at  uc  yesterday  and  apologizes  if  he  seemed  a  little  out  of  it  today.  they  gave  him  another  pain  shot.
__label__0 just  spent  a  half  hour  ductaping  a  tin  can  only  to  through  it  out.  then  spent  about  an  hour  playing  with  ductape,  and  made  pouch  that  he  will  never  use.  *propname*  feels  really  cool  right  now.  :)
__label__0 "i  just  want  you  to  know  that  i'm  saying  something  brilliant.  i'm  just  not  explaining  it  very  well."
__label__0 has  the  systems  for  higher  brain  function  and  complex  thought  offline  at  the  moment.  we  apologize  for  any  incovience.  (such  as  the  spelling  of  this  update)
__label__0 mr.  frosty,  that  is  the  grand  finish  of  a  good  summer.
__label__0 has  decided  that  the  laws  of  physics  must  not  apply  to  his  project.  one  side  takes  .  seconds  to  drain  water  to  the  other  side.  the  other  side  takes  fron  .  seconds  to  .  seconds  to  empty.  the  same  results  happen  over  and  over  with  no  explanation
__label__0 "just  because  i  know  everything  doesn't  mean  i'll  be  telling  you  anything  true."
__label__0 s  mind  has  decided  to  check  out  for  a  while.  it  left  a  note  saying  it  should  be  back  around    am  tomorrow.
__label__0 s  head  would  explode  if  his  skull  wasn't  being  hammered  on  by  numerious  sledge  hammers.  needless  to  say  my  headache  has  decided  over  the  counter  painkillers  only  make  it  more  angry.
__label__0 "...  and  then  i  have  a  witty  response."  -house
__label__0 i'm  on  call,  to  be  there.
__label__0 "its  only  illegal  if  you  get  caught,  assuming  you're  stupid  enough  to  get  caught  in  the  first  place"
__label__0 feels  the  need  to  say  something  deep  and  profound,  but  its  very  late  and  he  is  tired  from  his  workout  today.  with  those  conditions  this  is  the  best  he's  got.
__label__0 does  all  his  status  updates  in  rd  person.  this  will  likely  never  change.
__label__0 is  exhausted,  stressed,  and  is  having  an  awarding  winning  bad  luck  streak  in  terms  of  things  going  his  way.  but  for  whatever  reason  was  nominated  for  the  homecoming  courts.
__label__0 is  tired  and  probably  sick  but  likes  to  stay  positive  and  think  its  just  allergies(pretty  sure  thats  spelled  wrong  too).  but  had  an  amazing  time  at  a  murder  mystery  party  being  the  main  investigator,  and  was  close  to  getting  the  right  answer  but  didn't  have  enough  information.  he  also  intends  to  finish  polishing  an  essay  for  english  that  is  way  longer  than  any  essay  really  has  the  right  to  be.
__label__0 just  washed  a  paper  plate  so  that  he  could  use  it  for  something  else.  it  would  have  been  easier  to  just  grab  a  new  one  right  next  to  him.
__label__0 has  probably,  most  likely,  lost  what  ever  symbolance  of  a  mind  he  once  held.
__label__0 "she  only  drinks  coffee  at  midnight.  when  the  moment  is  not  right,  and  her  timing  is  quite,  unusual."
__label__0 made  the  most  amazing  burritos  for  dinner  and  feels  sad  that  he  can't  finish  them  and  enjoy  their  great  deliciousness  anylonger...

__label__0 just  reliezed  that  devouring  chinese  food  the  night  before  a  k  test  isn't  the  best  choice  of  foods  to  have  consumed  if  he  wanted  to  do  well  on  the  test.
__label__0 saw  the  mouse  trap!  it  was  positively  amazing!!!  great  work  to  everyone!!

__label__0 is  making  better  than  sex  cake.  it  better  be,  it  certainly  costs  enough.
__label__0 santa  isn't  bringing  me  presents  this  year.  he  sent  mal  and  river  to  do  it,  i  don't  think  he  considered  the  noise  factor  of  serenity  though.  (if  any  of  you  get  the  extreeeemly  geeky  reference  i'm  making,  just  smile  and  accept  that  every  year  i  wish  for  firefly  to  start  up  again)(hint,  hint,  santa)

__label__0 [c]  legal  writing  sucks.  [r]  something  is  deemed  to  "suck"  if  it  takes  an  innordinate  amount  of  time  to  complete  in  mind  numbing  silence  that  slowly  drives  you  fucking  crazy.  [e]  in  berkovitch  it  was  determined  that  working  on  "pennoyer",  an  outdated  case  that  has  no  bearing  on  actual  modern  day  law  "sucks"  because  it  took  over    hours  and  drove  him  fucking  crazy...

__label__1 .  .  .  doing  me.  .  .  you  do  you.  .  .
__label__1 dentist  got  me  med-up!      "percoset  is  a  hell-of-a-drug!"
__label__1 i'm  really  feeling  this  chicago  winter  right  now.  .  .  dunno  if  i'll  make  it  back  to  texas  with  all  my  fingertips.  .  .
__label__1 preparing  my  mind  for  a  long  drive.  .  .
__label__1 the  woman  came  out  of  a  man's  rib,  not  from  his  feet  to  be  walked  on,  not  from  his  head  to  be  superior,  but  from  his  side  to  be  equal!  under  the  arm  to  be  protected,  &  next  to  the  heart  to  be  loved.
__label__1 preparing  for  tryouts  and  the  start  of  steelers  season  .  .  .  its  that  time  of  year  again!
__label__1 yea  cchs  jv  -  starting  off  the  season  with  a  win!
__label__1 lazy  day  around  the  house  after  the  family  has  left.
__label__1 cchs  jv  -  you  girls  rock!    what  else  can  i  say?    and  mega  shout-out  to  *propname*  for  moral  support    tonight  and  rockin'  programs.
__label__1 back  at  it
__label__1 at  work  on  a  sunday  -  but  at  least  the  steelers  won  last  night!
__label__1 jenna's  wedding
__label__1 here  we  go,  steelers,  here  we  go!
__label__1 anyone  in  the  pitttsburgh  area  able  to  work  the  polls  on  tuesday?    i've  got  a  friend  that  needs  help.    let  me  know.    thanks.
__label__1 steelers,  steelers,  steelers
__label__1 i  have  the  best  boyfriend  ever.    thanks  babe,  i  love  you!
__label__1 working  at  home,  wathcing  the  *propname*  game,  and  watching  the  snow.    the  words  "lazy  saturday"  come  to  mind.
__label__1 and  yes,  i  misspelled  "watching"  not  once,  but  twice.
__label__1 wow,  that  was  a  great  game  -  even  if  *propname*  did  lose.  hope  the    v.    game  tonight  is  that  good.
__label__1 really?    two  days  in  a  row?    i  would  like  to  take  back  my  comment  about  de  ja  vu  -  i  didn't  mean  i  wanted  it  to  end  like  that  (again).
__label__1 absence  sharpens  love,  presence  stregthens  it
__label__1 it'a  kinda  like  de  ja  vu  -  working  at  home,  wathcing  the  *propname*  (steelers)  game,  and  snow  is  still  on  the  ground.    good  thing  i  know  its  sunday!
__label__1 put  this  as  your  status  if  you  or  somebody  you  know  has  suffered  the  loss  of  a  baby  ?  the  majority  won't  put  it  on  because  unlike  cancer.  baby  loss  is  a  taboo...  break  the  silence  ?  this  is  in  memory  of  all  the  angel  babies...gone  too  soon  but  never  forgotten  about!!?  show  your  support  and  let  these  women  know  they  don't  have  to  grieve  alone.
__label__1 if  you  &  i  woke  up  in  jail  together...using  only  four  words...what  would  you  say  to  me?  copy  and  paste  this  in  your  status  and  see  what  funny  things  your  friends  say....(and  if  you  make  a  comment,  you  gotta  put  this  in  your  status.  fair  is  fair.)
__label__1 if  i  ruled  the  world  .  .  .  imagine  that  .  .  .
__label__1 how  does  that  kind  of  fallen  even  happen  that  quickly?
__label__1 steelers,  steelers,  steelers!
__label__0 the  old  mans  still  trying  to  get  me  smashed  on  his  sake...  tastes  like  ass..  on  fire
__label__0 finally  using  facebook  n_n  feels  strange.
__label__0 mmm  waffles  n_n
__label__0 avril  stuck  in  my  head  from  yesterdays  singing  performance.  soooo  sad
__label__0 freezing  my  freakin  ass  off.  don't  want  to  get  out  of  bed  for  anything  today  :(
__label__0 *propname*  and  *propname*  are  officially  the  two  most  awesome  people  ever  :)
__label__0 toast  n_n  *purrs*
__label__0 marty  liebich......  lol
__label__0 breaking  hearts  is  part  of  who  you  are.
__label__0 i  give  up.
__label__0 mainstream.  all  day  long...  kill  it.
__label__0 goddam  it.  this  celebrity  double  thing  is  driving  me  crazy.  help
__label__0 just  remembered,  i  seen  a  naked  guy  running  up  the  supports  on  the  squinty  bridge  last  night  with  all  hanging  out  ..  but  wearing  socks.  not  a  pretty  sight.
__label__0 seen  a  leaflet  guy  coming  into  building.  so  i  collected  together  all  the  leaflets  we  have  (about  -)  and  when  he  went  to  post  the  leaflets  i  posted  them  all  outwards  as  he  opened  the  letterbox.  he  looked  a  little  confused  and  tried  to  push  them  back,  so  i  posted  them  back  out  again.  ahh  its  fun  to  piss  off  people.
__label__0 feeling  like  crap,  no  temperature  though  so  at  least  its  not  swine  flu  (at  least  i  think  its  not!)
__label__0 got  a  pair  of  degu's  last  night,  already  causing  issues!  they  are  uber  cute  though.
__label__0 got  a  refferal  to  a  ent  specialist  so  i  can  get  a  camera  jammed  up  my  nose  into  my  sinuses.  not  pretty  but  at  least  i  may  be  able  to  finally  get  rid  of  this  damn  sinus  infection!  :d
__label__0 trying  to  send  docs  to  the  bank,  and  my  personal  advisor  is  not  trusted  with  email  or  web  access  full  access  to  my  account,  financial  and  personal,  but  not  email  *worry*
__label__0 gotta  love    mobile.  i  asked  to  cancel  my  contract  and  was  asked  "could  we  convince  you  to  stay"  i  replied  with  "due  to  the  terrible  customer  service,  i  would  rather  die  a  slow  and  horribly  painful  death  than  stay"  to  which  i  got  "do  you  have  any  friends  or  relatives  you  would  like  to  refer  so  they  can  get  a  good  deal".  i  want  that  csr  to  work  in  my  company  retention  department!!
__label__0 i  think  i  must  be  doing  something  wrong  on  the  trapeze,  it  feels  like  i  have  just  went  for  a  vasectomy  after  trying  a  few  windmills  yesterday.  no  pain  no  gain  :)
__label__0 arghhh!!!  the  radio  has  christmas  songs  on  it  already,  this  bad  bad  bad  news!  its  november  !!
__label__0 i  have  .kg  of  explosives  for  nov    (the  uk  equiv  of  th  july  for  the  americans),  hopefully  with  any  luck  this  thing  will  make  the  night  time  look  like  daytime  with  the  bang  :d
__label__0 trying  to  weigh  a  degu  is  not  easy!
__label__0 never  had  a  crab,  squid,  musccle,  scallop,  and  anchovie  pizza  before.  it  is  however  suprisingly  good  :)
__label__0 whilst  i  may  not  understand  the  history  behind  thanksgiving,  i  can  get  behind  any  holiday  that  consists  of  a  huge  amount  of  food,  alcohol  and  friends.  happy  thanksgiving  to  my  american  friends.  and  to  anyone  else,  today  is  just  an  excuse  for  us  to  take  part  in  "cultural  diversity"  and  get  drunk  and  stuffed  with  lots  of  food.
__label__0 is  thinking  that  he  needs  to  assemble  a  horde  of  flying  panda  colored  monkies  to  wreck  havock  on  the  world  from  above,  and  buy  milk.
__label__0 i  can  handle  the  scope  thing  being  shoved  up  my  nose  and  down  my  throat,  i  can  handle  the  ct  scan,  but  having  blood  taken,  still  can't  deal  with  that!
__label__0 why  are  you  not  allowed  to  give  kids  nuts  for  halloween  any  more.  i  got  them  as  a  kid,  and  as  far  as  i  am  aware  people  havne't  become  more  allergic  to  it  in  the  last    years,  just  the  same  amount.
__label__0 hates  facebook  messaging,  it  always  looks  like  you  are  waiting  for  the  other  person  to  message  back,  and  then  you  see  that  it  has  infact  timed  out  (again)  and  the  person  messaged  back    hours  ago.  *sigh*
__label__0 i  have  discovered  the  'teddy  bear'  move  in  aerials,  is  anything  but  cute  and  fluffy!  its  evil,  sore  and  likes  nothing  more  than  cutting  off  all  blood  to  your  extrematies.
__label__0 is  currently  working  his  way  through  the  harry  potter  box  set.  can't  say  i  don't  have  exciting  weekends!
__label__0 i  know    sick  people  at  the  moment,  and  now  i'm  sick.  i'm  going  to  find  out  what  one  it  was  and  come  after  them!!  watch  yourselves  ;)
__label__0 happy  jul,  in  norway  they  don't  celebrate  chriastmas  as  much  as  julaften  (pre-christmas).  thats  when  people  get  their  pressies.  in  russia  its  the  th  jan!    don't  know  if  i  could  wait  that  long!
__label__0 i  love  how  much  fun  you  can  have  with  non  newtonian  fluids  :d
__label__0 the  turkey  is  now  officially  drunk  (injected  with  enough  alcohol  that  if  we  didn't  eat  it,  it'd  be  at  aa).  rubbed  with  secret  spices,  drizzled  in  bacon,  and  the  silverside  joint  is  slowly  cooking  for    hours.    minute  break  then    back  to  cooking  :d
__label__0 my  brother  gave  me  a  uni-cycle  for  xmas.  i'm  wondering  if  you  can  pre  book  appointments  to  the  a&e  to  save  time.
__label__0 just  hacked  my  appletv,  removed  the  wifi  chip  and  replaced  with  a  broadcom  h.  hardware  decoder  chip.  now  i  can  stream  blu  ray  movies  in  p  from  my  fileserver  to  tv  :d
__label__0 just  realised  he  missed  the  aerial  class  start  :|  thought  it  was  next  week  it  started  doh!
__label__0 thinks  that  the  new  apple  tablet  'pc'  ipad  sounds  like  a  high  tech  sanitary  device.
__label__0 merry  christmas  everyone  :)
__label__0 they  are  not  beef  sausages  if  they  are  only  %  beef!  lies!
__label__0 just  made  a  spiced  haddock  on  trimmed  green  bean  and  coconut  rice  with  a  coconut,  chilli  sauce...  mmm
__label__1 it's  time  i  fire  up  this  life  i'm  livin'  in!
__label__1 cuando  la  vida  misma  te  ha  puesto  en  un  aprieto,  �qu�  es  lo  que  se  debe  hacer?
__label__1 que  es  lo  que  en  realidad  se  debe  de  hacer?  lo  que  el  coraz�n  dicta  o  lo  que  la  razon  te  dice?
__label__1 es  momento  de  aprender  a  dejar  ir  las  cosas.  por  favor,  que  aquella  luz,  gu�a  m�a,  me  lleve  a  los  lugares  indicados.
__label__1 oscilando  entre  la  infinidad  de  la  mente  y  la  infinidad  del  sue�o...
__label__1 hay  veces  en  las  que  simplemente  quisiera  olvidarme  de  todo  y  refugiarme  en  la  profundidad  de  mi  mente...
__label__1 meus  somnerium...  en  busca  de  un  peque�o  momento  de  comprensi�n...
__label__1 de  vuelta  al  mundo  interno  sin  l�mites!
__label__1 por  favor,  que  las  cosas  mejoren!  si  es  que  en  verdad  alguien  puede  ayudar,  que  le  otorguen  lo  que  necesita!
__label__1 getting  ready  for  the  fun!  escapada  espiritual  al  coraz�n  del  or�culo...  riviera  maya!  meus  somnierum!
__label__1 i  want  to  reconcile  the  violence  in  your  heart!  i  want  to  recognise  your  beauty  is  not  just  a  mask!  i  want  to  exorcise  the  demons  from  your  past!  i  want  to  satisfy  the  undisclosed  desires  in  your  heart!  (gracias  a  sofi  por  la  canci�n  tan  genial!)
__label__1 i  just...  don't  know  what  to  think  anymore...
__label__1 life  truly  has  special  ways  to  show  us  what  we  need...  in  the  weirdest  moments////f  i  n  a  l  f  a  n  t  a  s  y////"i  know.  i'm  not  alone...  not  anymore."
__label__1 back  to  the  routine,  then...
__label__1 is  trying  to  get  out  of  the  doldrums
__label__1 is  in  aruba!!!
__label__1 --  people  need  to  get  over  michael  vick's  life  and  get  their  own
__label__1 vegas  baby!!!  yaaa!!!!
__label__1 once  again  doesn't  remember  going  to  bed.  and  she's  upset  with  how  much  drunk  *propname*  tries  to  screw  around  with  hungover  *propname*.  this  isn't  funny  drunk  *propname*.
__label__1 is  glad  that  it's  summertime,  and  the  living  is  easy.  one  of  these  mornings,  she'll  rise  up  singing.
__label__1 just  got  home  from  spending    glorious  hours  with  her  family.  it  was  an  awesome  day.  sorry  for  all  the  missed  calls  and  texts,  my  phone  died  many  hours  ago.
__label__1 i'm  leavin'  on  a  cruise  ship,  but  i  do  know  when  i'll  be  back  again.  seriously  though,  no  phone  or  internet  all  week,  so  i  will  be  incommunicado.  you  kids  have  fun,  try  not  to  do  anything  too  crazy.
__label__1 is  home  again!  the  caribbean  was  amazing!
__label__1 had  good  talkings  tonight.  fun  times  were  had  by  all.
__label__1 one  more  double  before  nine  days  of  freedom.
__label__1 can't  stop  here!  this  is  bat  country!
__label__1 you  win  some,  you  lose  some.  week    doesn't  say  anything  about  the  playoffs.  there's  always  next  week.  and  lets  be  fair,  the  competition  next  week  is  the  chiefs.  ahahaha.
__label__1 ought  to  be  cast  in  the  next  big  zombie  movie  as  an  extra.  because  she  feels  like  the  living  dead  must  feel  after  a  night  of  heavy  brain-eating.  is  that  their  equivalent  of  drinking?  explains  why  they  want  to  do  it  all  the  time.
__label__1 needs  to  be  herself,  she  can't  be  no  one  else.  she's  feeling  supersonic,  give  her  gin  and  tonic.  she  could  have  it  all,  but  how  much  does  she  want  it?
__label__1 damn,  those  eagles  looked  sharp  today.  too  bad  the  red  sox  couldn't  do  the  same.
__label__1 made  some  cash  last  night  playing  poker.  hopefully  a  repeat  performance  tonight?
__label__1 hasn't  felt  the  way  she  feels  today  in  so  long  it's  hard  for  her  to  specify.
__label__1 has  got  no  time  to  for  spreadin  roots,  the  time  has  come  to  be  gone.  and  though  our  health  we  drank  a  thousand  times,  it's  time  to  ramble  on.
__label__1 is  at  a  weird  place  in  her  life  right  now.  a  road  map  would  be  handy.
__label__1 has  the  damn  flu.  could  the  universe's  timing  have  been  any  worse?  she  thinks  not.
__label__1 woot,  go  chiefs.  :d
__label__1 would  love  to  have  something  that  even  remotely  resembles  a  reasonable  sleep  schedule.
__label__1 feels  severely  under-appreciated.  it's  lame.
__label__1 has  had  a  very  good  day,  and  looks  to  have  a  good  night  also.
__label__1 doesn't  look  different,  but  she  has  changed.  you're  looking  through  her,  she's  not  the  same.
__label__1 wants  to  live  where  soul  meets  body,  and  let  the  sun  wrap  its  arms  around  her,  and  bathe  her  skin  in  water  cool  and  cleansing,  and  feel,  feel  what  it's  like  to  be  new.
__label__1 has  learned  that  standing  in  front  of  her  open  refridgerator  and  freezer  doesn't  make  any  of  her  food  look  any  more  appetizing,  but  it  does  start  defrosting  the  food  in  her  freezer.
__label__1 proved  her  epic  ninja  skills  tonight.
__label__1 shall  live  in  the  sunshine,  swim  the  sea,  and  drink  the  wild  air's  salubrity.
__label__1 was  hoping  some  of  the  punk  kids  in  her  apartment  complex  would  nab  the  jack-o-lanterns  off  her  balcony  and  give  them  the  honor  of  a  good  smash.  instead  she  had  to  unceremoniously  toss  them  in  the  dumpster.
__label__1 will  begin  tomorrow  well  and  serenely  and  with  too  high  a  spirit  to  be  encumbered  with  her  old  nonsense.
__label__1 is  gonna  blame  it  all  upon  a  rush  of  blood  to  the  head.
__label__1 had  one  of  her  worst  nights  ever  at  work,  after  spending  all  day  actually  believing  today  would  be  a  good  day.
__label__1 will  have  a  bit  of  fun,  watching  everyone  pass  her  by.
__label__1 is  sitting  in  an  english  garden,  waiting  for  the  sun.
__label__1 ():  fact:  the  drinking  you  do  in  college  doesn't  affect  your  liver  in  real  life.
__label__1 wanted  more  than  life  could  ever  grant.  she's  bored  with  the  chore  of  saving  face.
__label__1 loves  that  she  has  some  of  the  nerdiest  friends  ever.  she's  seen  at  least  ten  *propname*  poems  posted  today.  granted,  everyone  picks  the  same  one  from  v  for  vendetta,  but  m'eh.
__label__1 is  feeling  uninspired  and  unmotivated.  can  someone  else  please  pay  her  bills  and  move  her  into  her  new  apartment?
__label__1 is  tired  of  being  passed  over.
__label__1 has  gotta  tell  you  what  a  state  she's  in...
__label__1 is  having  the  worst  day  since  yesterday.
__label__1 learns  more  and  more  every  day  that  timing  is  everything.
__label__1 is  still  living  with  your  ghost,  lonely  and  dreaming  of  the  west  coast.  she  just  wants  to  feel  some  sunshine.
__label__1 just  thought  that  you  would  know  you're  a  god,  and  she  is  not.
__label__1 took  these  broken  wings  and  learned  to  fly.  all  her  life,  she  was  only  waiting  for  this  moment  to  arise.
__label__1 doesn't  want  to  be  at  the  mercy  of  her  emotions.  she  wants  to  use  them,  to  enjoy  them,  and  to  dominate  them.
__label__1 is  watching  the  lights  go  down,  letting  the  cables  sleep.  whatever  you  say,  it's  all  right,  whatever  you  do  it's  all  good.
__label__1 is  simultaneously  packing,  doing  laundry,  cleaning,  and  jamming  out.    ah,  productivity.
__label__1 is  home  from  work  and  back  to  packing//cleaning.  january  nd  can't  come  soon  enough,  because  this  is  starting  to  get  really  monotonous.
__label__1 can  be  painfully  petty  and  selfish  at  times.
__label__1 doppelg�nger  week;  change  your  profile  picture  to  someone  famous  you  have  been  told  you  look  like.  after  you  update  your  profile  with  your  evil  twin  photo,  then  cut  and  paste  this  to  your  status.
__label__1 wants  the  kind  of  things  that  money  just  can't  buy.
__label__1 hates  to  admit  that  she's  becoming  more  and  more  of  a  morning  person.
__label__1 is  very  glad  to  see  that  it's  legitimately  storming  outside.  if  only  she  didn't  have  to  go  back  to  work  in  just  a  few  minutes...
__label__1 is,  by  far,  the  biggest  nerd  she  knows  sometimes.  which  really  says  a  lot  if  you  know  her  friends.
__label__1 just  realized  she's  been  awake  for    hours.  that  might  explain  the  exhaustion.
__label__1 had  an  amazing  night  last  night,  in  spite  of  the  fact  that  she  was  literally  falling  asleep  on  her  feet.
__label__0 your  grace  is  more  than  enough.  re-prioritization  in  progress.
__label__0 stepped  down  from  the  last  stage.  but  i  won't  say  goodbye.  well  done,  *propname*:)
__label__0 free  style
__label__0 loves  his  ginosko  ppl.

__label__0 it  needs  to  be  sunny  so  i  can  invite  a  bunch  of  peeps  over
__label__0 i  have  never  changed  my  facebook  pic  ever,  that  should  be  a  record  right?
__label__1 is  sleepy  and  doesn't  want  to  pack
__label__1 is  leaving  soon
__label__1 has  been  putting  off  patching  up  the  holes  in  her  clothing...and  it's  starting  to  show.
__label__1 is  trying  to  get  her  hearing  back  after  nibbler  decided  to  imitate  her  sneezing...very  loudly.
__label__1 is  awake  and  packing..  ;__;
__label__1 is  sick  and  tired  of  marketing.
__label__1 just  rubbed  red  pepper  oil  in  her  eye.  ;____;  fuck.
__label__1 "this  is  your  life  and  it's  ending  one  minute  at  a  time."
__label__1 is  off  camping
__label__1 can't  figure  out  how  to  get  her  hair  cut.  any  suggestions?
__label__1 "the  world  is  my  ashtray"
__label__1 is  blowing  magnificent  spit  bubbles.
__label__1 needs  to  stop  buying  things  online  or  she's  going  to  be  penniless.
__label__1 is  in  lake  placid  and  it's  wonderful.
__label__1 needs  to  finish  her  work...but  is  very  lazy.
__label__1 can't  sleep  again.
__label__1 should  give  up  on  art  and  be  a  scientist.
__label__1 has  nothing  to  do  today.
__label__1 should  give  up  on  being  a  scientist  and  become  a  cave  hermit.
__label__1 should  stop  wasting  her  time,  go  to  college  and  get  a  real  job.
__label__1 is  too  liberal  for  canandaigua.
__label__1 really  loves  the  fall
__label__1 "but  he  hung  up  the  phone  slow  and  sad.  dad  said  "the  worst  thing  about  living  here  is  that  you  can  only  kill  yourself  once.""
__label__1 looks  sick  most  of  the  time.
__label__1 well,  see  what  you  want  to  see,  you  should  see  it  all.  well,  take  what  you  want  from  me,  you  deserve  it  all.  nine  times  out  of  ten  our  hearts  just  get  dissolved.  well,  i  want  a  better  place  or  just  a  better  way  to  fall.
__label__1 is  trying  to  find  an  apartment.
__label__1 should  probably  go  to  sleep  soon..
__label__1 hasn't  been  online  in  a  long  time
__label__1 packing  up  my  crap  and  moving  this  week.  i  can't  afford  cable  or  internet  service  so  you'll  have  to  text  me  if  you  want  to  talk  to  me.  my  phone  number  is  -  if  you  didn't  already  know.
__label__1 bored  with  things,  i  need  to  find  something  else  to  focus  on  obsessively.
__label__1 just  finished  drill...  people  fell  out
__label__1 need  to  do  calc
__label__1 grilling  with  the  battalion
__label__1 working  on  calculus
__label__1 military  science  iii
__label__1 had  to  move  to  delta
__label__1 there  is  no  squabbling  so  violent  as  that  between  people  who  accepted  an  idea  yesterday  and  those  who  will  accept  the  same  idea  tomorrow.
__label__1 back  to  class
__label__1 battalion  level  smoke  session  at  
__label__1 calc,  history,  comp,  then  chem
__label__1 height  and  weight  test  under  bravo
__label__1 chem  and  then  im  done  with  classes  for  the  day
__label__1 i  hate  wednesdays
__label__1 adversity  causes  some  men  to  break,  others  to  break  records............  ..back  from  the  gym
__label__1 ms  iii  class
__label__1 phone  sucks
__label__1 i  apologize  for  my  last  status  no  real  smoke  session  took  place...im  not  sure  what  it  was
__label__1 no
__label__1 dream  as  if  you  have  forever.  live  as  if  you  only  have  today
__label__1 going  to  the  gym
__label__1 think  what  a  better  world  it  would  be  if  we  all,  the  whole  world,  had  cookies  and  milk  about  three  o'clock  every  afternoon  and  then  lay  down  on  our  blankets  for  a  nap...
__label__1 do  not  go  where  the  path  may  lead,  go  instead  where  there  is  no  path  and  leave  a  trail
__label__1 parade  practice...worst  time  of  the  day
__label__1 he  who  strikes  first,  strikes  twice.
__label__1 it's  amazing  that  the  amount  of  news  that  happens  in  the  world  every  day  always  just  exactly  fits  the  newspaper
__label__1 anybody  who  wants  to  do  stx  lanes  tonight  report  to  delta  barracks  by  ...full  battle  rattle..this  includes  rucksack,lbv  with  compass  and  water,  dummy  rifle,  and  redlines  flashlight..have  assault  pack  in  rucksack  bring  kevlar  and  pc
__label__1 going  to  the  gym...hit  me  up  later
__label__1 some  people  walk  in  the  rain,  others  just  get  wet
__label__1 anyone  who  can  be  replaced  by  a  machine  deserves  to  be
__label__1 may  have  overworked  my  abs  today...feel  torn
__label__1 the  undertaking  of  a  new  action  brings  new  strength
__label__1 going  for  a  long  run  hit  me  up  later
__label__1 most  people  never  run  far  enough  on  their  first  wind  to  find  out  they've  got  a  second
__label__1 i  like  running  because  it's  a  challenge.    if  you  run  hard,  there's  the  pain  -  and  you've  got  to  work  your  way  through  the  pain.    you  know,  lately  it  seems  all  you  hear  is?  don't  overdo  it'  and?  don't  push  yourself.'  well,  i  think  that's  a  lot  of  bull  shit.    if  you  push  the  human  body,  it  will  respond
__label__1 the  person  who  says  it  cannot  be  done  should  not  interrupt  the  person  doing  it.
__label__1 the  trouble  with  being  punctual  is  that  nobody's  there  to  appreciate  it
__label__1 if  you  want  to  be  a  leader  try  and  act  like  one
__label__1 there  is  genius  in  persistence.  it  conquers  all  opposers.  it  gives  confidence.  it  annihilates  obstacles.  everybody  believes  in  a  determined  man.  people  know  that  when  he  undertakes  a  thing,  the  battle  is  half  won,  for  his  rule  is  to  accomplish  whatever  he  sets  out  to  do.
__label__1 if  i  am  not  for  myself,  who  will  be  for  me?  if  i  am  not  for  others,  what  am  i?and  if  not  now,  when?
__label__1 lunch  then  going  to  work  out....any  workout  which  does  not  involve  a  certain  amount  of  danger  or  responsibility  does  not  improve  the  body  -  it  just  wears  it  out
__label__1 the  first  rule  is  to  keep  an  untroubled  spirit.  the  second  is  to  look  things  in  the  face  and  know  them  for  what  they  are
__label__1 you  don't  drown  by  falling  in  water.  you  drown  by  staying  there.
__label__1 if  i  had  to  select  one  quality,  one  personal  characteristic  that  i  regard  as  being  most  highly  correlated  with  success,  whatever  the  field,  i  would  pick  the  trait  of  persistence.  determination.  the  will  to  endure  to  the  end,  to  get  knocked  down  seventy  times  and  get  up  off  the  floor  saying,  ''here  comes  number  seventy-one!
__label__1 .if  we  wait  for  the  moment  when  everything,    absolutely  everything  is  ready,  we  shall  never  begin
__label__1 getting  smoked  tonight
__label__1 i'm  a  great  believer  in  luck,  and  i  find  the  harder  i  work,  the  more  i  have  of  it.
__label__1 your  toughness  is  made  up  of  equal  parts  persistence  and  experience.  you  don't  so  much  outrun  your  opponents  as  outlast  and  outsmart  them,  and  the  toughest  opponent  of  all  is  the  one  inside  your  head
__label__1 going  on  a  run
__label__1 monday..enough  said
__label__1 jealousy  is  the  tribute  mediocrity  pays  to  genius.
__label__1 i  long  to  accomplish  a  great  and  noble  task,  but  it  is  my  chief  duty  to  accomplish  humble  tasks  as  though  they  were  great  and  noble
__label__1 the  average  estimate  themselves  by  what  they  do,  the  above  average  by  what  they  are
__label__1 phones  dead
__label__1 running  the  course,  then  to  the  weight  room
__label__1 personally,  i  don't  think  there's  intelligent  life  on  other  planets.  why  should  other  planets  be  any  different  from  this  one?
__label__1 since  the  house  is  on  fire  let  us  warm  ourselves
__label__1 going  to  the  qm
__label__1 msc  iii  class..
__label__1 good  day...goodnight
__label__1 got  my  battle  rattle  ready
__label__1 education  is  a  progressive  discovery  of  our  own  ignorance
__label__1 common  sense  in  an  uncommon  degree  is  what  the  world  calls  wisdom
__label__1 executive  ability  is  deciding  quickly  and  getting  somebody  else  to  do  the  work.
__label__1 those  who  live  by  the  sword  get  shot  by  those  who  don't.
__label__1 why  did  i  want  to  win?  because  i  didn't  want  to  lose!
__label__1 despise  the  fact  i  have  already  been  up  for  almost    hours
__label__1 nothing  in  the  world  can  take  the  place  of  persistence.  talent  will  not;  nothing  is  more  common  than  unsuccessful  men  with  talent.  genius  will  not;  unrewarded  genius  is  almost  proverb.  education  will  not;  the  world  is  full  of  educated  derelicts.  persistence  and  determination  alone  are  omnipotent
__label__1 the  will  to  win  means  nothing  without  the  will  to  prepare
__label__1 excellence  is  an  art  won  by  training  and  habituation.  we  do  not  act  rightly  because  we  have  virtue  or  excellence,  but  we  rather  have  those  because  we  have  acted  rightly.  we  are  what  we  repeatedly  do.  excellence,  then,  is  not  an  act  but  a  habit.
__label__1 i've  got  a  great  ambition  to  die  of  exhaustion  rather  than  boredom
__label__1 if  life  gives  you  lemons  -  make  grapejuice.  then  sit  back  and  let  people  wonder  how  you  did  it.
__label__1 since  light  travels  faster  than  sound,    people  appear  bright  until  you  hear  them  speak
__label__1 if  you  can't  convince  them,  confuse  them
__label__1 first  free  weekend
__label__1 the  power  of  accurate  observation  is  frequently  called  cynicism  by  those  who  don't  have  it
__label__1 far  better  it  is  to  dare  mighty  things,  to  win  glorious  triumphs  even  though  checkered  by  failure,  than  to  rank  with  those  poor  spirits  who  neither  enjoy  nor  suffer  much  because  they  live  in  the  gray  twilight  that  knows  neither  victory  nor  defeat.
__label__1 here's  to  you  and  here's  to  me,  and  i  hope  we  never  disagree.  but,  if  that  should  ever  be,  to  hell  with  you,  here's  to  me
__label__1 just  because  everything's  different  doesn't  mean  anything's  changed
__label__1 as  it  is  the  characteristic  of  great  wits  to  say  much  in  few  words,  so  small  wits  seem  to  have  the  gift  of  speaking  much  and  saying  nothing.
__label__1 it  doesn't  work  to  leap  a  twenty-foot  canyon  in  two  ten-foot  jumps
__label__1 common  sense  is  instinct.    enough  of  it  is  genius
__label__1 finished  ruck  run
__label__1 i've  always  felt  it  was  not  up  to  anyone  else  to  make  me  give  my  best
__label__1 sometimes                                                        it  is  entirely  appropriate  to  kill  a  fly  with  a  sledge                                                        hammer
__label__1 chem  test
__label__1 dreams  permit  each  and  every  one  of  us  to  be  quietly  and  safely  insane  every  night  of  our  lives
__label__1 i'm  not  the  greatest;  i'm  the  double  greatest.  not  only  do  i  knock  'em  out,  i  pick  the  round.
__label__1 if  one  can  stick  to  the  training  throughout  the  many  long  years,  then  will  power  is  no  longer  a  problem.  it's  raining?  that  doesn't  matter.  i  am  tired?  that's  besides  the  point.  it's  simply  that  i  just  have  to
__label__1 it  seems  rather  incongruous  that  in  a  society  of  supersophisticated  communication,  we  often  suffer  from  a  shortage  of  listeners
__label__1 if  the  path  less  traveled  were  the  easy  path,  then  all  would  take  it,  thus  making  greatness  simply  average
__label__1 people  demand  freedom  of  speech  to  make  up    for  the  freedom  of  thought  which  they  avoid
__label__1 no  matter  where  you  go,  there  you  are
__label__1 there  is  no  point  at  which  you  can  say,  well,  i'm  successful  now.  i  might  as  well  take  a  nap
__label__1 just  got  back  from  rugby  and  the  weight  room,  going  to  eat....hit  me  up  later
__label__1 if                                                        you're  in  a  fair  fight,  you  didn't  plan  it  properly
__label__1 your                          problem  is  that  you  think  you  have  time
__label__1 light  thinks  it  travels  faster  than  anything  but  it  is  wrong.  no  matter  how  fast  light  travels,  it  finds  the  darkness  has  always  got  there  first,  and  is  waiting  for  it.
__label__1 it's  amazing  that  the  amount  of  news  that  happens  in  the  world  every  day  always  just  exactly  fits  the  newspaper
__label__1 perseverance  is  more  than  endurance.  it  is  endurance  combined  with  absolute  assurance  and  certainty  that  what  we  are  looking  for  is  going  to  happen
__label__1 before  you  criticize  someone,  you  should  walk  a  mile  in  their  shoes.  that  way  when  you  criticize  them,  you  are  a  mile  away  from  them  and  you  have  their  shoes
__label__1 it  is  the  characteristic  excellence  of  the  strong  man  that  he  can  bring  momentous  issues  to  the  fore  and  make  a  decision  about  them.  the  weak  are  always  forced  to  decide  between  alternatives  they  have  not  chosen  themselves.
__label__1 i  can  picture  in  my  mind  a  world  without  war,  a  world  without  hate.  and  i  can  picture  us  attacking  that  world,  because  they'd  never  expect  it
__label__1 motivation  is  a  fire  from  within.  if  someone  else  tries  to  light  that  fire  under  you,  chances  are  it  will  burn  very  briefly
__label__1 surprise  me
__label__1 success  is  not  the  result  of  spontaneous  combustion.  you  must  set  yourself  on  fire.
__label__1 if  a  cluttered  desk  is  the  sign  of  a  cluttered  mind,  what  is  the  significance  of  a  clean  desk?
__label__1 believing  requires  action
__label__1 between  two  evils  i  always  pick  the  one  ive  never  tried  before
__label__1 those  who  are  more  adapted  to  the  active  life  can  prepare  themselves  for  contemplation  in  the  practice  of  the  active  life,  while  those  who  are  more  adapted  to  the  contemplative  life  can  take  upon  themselves  the  works  of  the  active  life  so  as  to  become  yet  more  apt  for  contemplation
__label__1 where  am  i?
__label__1 thinking  is  more  interesting  than  knowing,  but  less  interesting  than  looking
__label__1 man  imposes  his  own  limitations,  don't  set  any
__label__1 we  run,  not  because  we  think  it  is  doing  us  good,  but  because  we  enjoy  it  and  cannot  help  ourselves...the  more  restricted  our  society  and  work  become,  the  more  necessary  it  will  be  to  find  some  outlet  for  this  craving  for  freedom.    no  one  can  say,  'you  must  not  run  faster  than  this,  or  hump  higher  than  that.'    the  human  spirit  is  indomitable
__label__1 what  i  must  do  is  all  that  concerns  me.  this  rule,  equally  arduous  in  actual  and  intellectual  life,  may  serve  for  the  whole  distinction  between  greatness  and  meanness.  it  is  harder  because  you  will  always  find  those  who  think  they  know  what  is  your  duty  better  than  you  know  it.
__label__1 restlessness  is  dicontent,  and  discontent  is  the  first  neccesity  of  progress
__label__1 i  cannot  have  survival  as  my  only  goal.    that  would  be  too  boring.
__label__1 http:////www.youtube.com//watch?v=kznto_efq&feature=playlist&p=edccfc&index=
__label__1 the  slower  we  move  the  faster  we  die
__label__1 one  reason  we  resist  making  deliberate  choices  is  that  choice  equals  change  and  most  of  us,  feeling  the  world  is  unpredictable  enough,  try  to  minimise  the  trauma  of  change  in  our  personal  lives.
__label__1 there  are  four  ways,  and  only  four  ways,  in  which  we  have  contact  with  the  world.  we  are  evaluated  and  classified  by  these  four  contacts:  what  we  do,  how  we  look,  what  we  say,  and  how  we  say  it.
__label__1 success  is  often  achieved  by  those  who  don't  know  that  failure  is  inevitable.
__label__1 workouts  are  like  brushing  my  teeth;  i  don't  think  about  them,  i  just  do  them.    the  decision  has  already  been  made
__label__1 leadership  is  no  more  confined  to  process,  than  writing  is  to  format
__label__1 staying  up  late  reading  an  analysis  of  caesars  civil  war  a  man  who  lived  by  the  quote  audacity,  more  audacity,  always  audacity,  his  amazing  success  in  life,  war,  and  politics  is  yet  another  hwever  old  testament  that  fortune  trully  does  favor  the  audacious  a  saying  that  seems  to  hold  more  truth  with  every  experience  i  have
__label__1 everyone  is  trying  to  accomplish  something  big,  not  realizing  that  life  is  made  up  of  little  things
__label__1 not  gonna  sleep  good  tonight
__label__1 no  bees,  no  honey;  no  work,  no  money.
__label__1 that  was  fun
__label__1 i  hate  the  expression  "what  makes  him  tick."    it  is  the  american  mind,  looking  for  simple  and  singular  solution,  that  uses  the  foolish  expression.    a  person  not  only  ticks,  he  also  chimes  and  strikes  the  hour,  falls  and  breaks  and  has  to  be  put  together  again,  and  sometimes  stops  like  an  electric  clock  in  a  thunderstorm
__label__1 going  to  work  out..then  mapping  and  setting  up  stx  lanes  for  tonight  hit  me  up  if  you  want  in
__label__1 fight  one  more  round.  when  your  arms  are  so  tired  that  you  can  hardly  lift  your  hands  to  come  on  guard,  fight  one  more  round.  when  your  nose  is  bleeding  and  your  eyes  are  black  and  you  are  so  tired  that  you  wish  your  opponent  would  crack  you  one  on  the  jaw  and  put  you  to  sleep,  fight  one  more  round  �  remembering  that  the  man  who  always  fights  one  more  round  is  never  beaten
__label__1 earlier  tonight,  i  found  a  picture  of  waldo  in  jail.  i  didn't  think  much  of  it  until  i  realized  he  was  probably  a  wanted  fugitive  and  that's  why  he  is  always  hiding
__label__1 what  is  opportunity  to  the  man  who  can't  use  it?
__label__1 dont  you  find  it  funny  that  after  monday(m)  and  tuesday(t),  the  rest  of  the  week  says  wtf?
__label__1 the  truth  is  that  our  finest  moments  are  most  likely  to  occur  when  we  are  feeling  deeply  uncomfortable,  unhappy,  or  unfulfilled.  for  it  is  only  in  such  moments,  propelled  by  our  discomfort,  that  we  are  likely  to  step  out  of  our  ruts  and  start  searching  for  different  ways  or  truer  answers
__label__1 read,  every  day,  something  no  one  else  is  reading.  think,  everyday,  something  no  one  else  is  thinking.  do,  every  day,  something  no  one  else  would  be  crazy  enough  to  do.
__label__1 someday
__label__1 there  is  no  better  time  than  now.  the  time  to  live  is  now.  the  time  to  dream  is  now.  the  time  to  imagine  and  forget  the  past  is  now.  the  time  to  shine  is  now.  the  time  to  bleed,  sweat,  and  determine  yourself  for  the  things  you  want  most  is  now.
__label__1 all  things  are  subject  to  interpretation  whichever  interpretation  prevails  at  a  given  time  is  a  function  of  power  and  not  truth.
__label__1 all  change  is  not  growth;  as  all  movement  is  not  forward.
__label__1 stx  on  friday  hit  me  up  if  you  want  in....the  greatest  potential  for  control  tends  to  exist  at  the  point  where  action  takes  place.
__label__1 dream  great...achieve  greatness
__label__1 our  business  in  life  is  not  to  get  ahead  of  others,  but  to  get  ahead  of  ourselves  --  to  break  our  own  records,  to  outstrip  our  yesterday  by  our  today.
__label__1 when  you  aim  for  perfection,  you    discover  it's  a  moving  target.
__label__1 go  to  urbandictionary.com,  type  in  your  first  name,  copy  and  paste  this  as  your  status,  and  put  the  first  entry  under  your  name  as  a  comment.
__label__1 my  alarm  clock  &  i  had  a  fight.  it  wanted  me  to  get  up,  i  refused.  things  escalated.  now  i'm  awake  &  it�s  broken.  not  sure  who  won  the  fight
__label__1 try  to  learn  something  about  everything  and  everything  about  something
__label__1 think..see.  ..act...
__label__1 a  failure  establishes  only  this,  that  our  determination  to  succeed  was  not  strong  enough
__label__1 don't  always  think  in  a  straight  line
__label__1 we  do  not  rise  to  the  level  of    our  expectations.  we  fall  to  the  level  of  our  training
__label__1 plis  entren  al  grupo  del  eski!!!!!!!  !!
__label__1 i  won  the  midna  game  twice,  and  she  doesnt  die,  she  only  gets  like  in  a  shoc,  but  she  ends  up  alive  :),  anyway,  im  so  happy  to  talk  to  u,  how  is  everything  going  on  there?  how  are  neftali,  stephany,  lewis,  andre  and  everybody  else?

__label__1 so  there's  something  about  a  super...bowl?  on  right  now?
__label__1 so  this  is  what  it's  like  to  be  bored  on  a  saturday  night...
__label__1 :  the  bubble  picture  is  up  as  requested.    on  a  related  note,  my  bike  has  fallen  victim  to  the  insatiable  hunger  of  *propname*'s  venus  bike  trap.
__label__0 is  in  a  good  mood,  which  is  a  nice  change.
__label__0 is  bored  being  back  home  already.
__label__0 needs  something  to  do.
__label__0 enjoyed  lunch  today.
__label__0 can't  be  arsed...
__label__0 needs  sleep  but  doesn't  want  it  to  stop  being  tonight.  damn  sleep  is  an  awful  habit.
__label__0 needs  something  to  do  tonight.
__label__0 remember,  remember,  the  fifth  of  november,  the  gunpowder  treason  and  plot.  i  know  of  no  reason  why  the  gunpowder  treason  should  ever  be  forgot...  but  what  of  the  man?
__label__0 just  bought  five  finger  death  punch:  the  way  of  the  fist  as  well  as  breaking  *propname*:  dear  agony,  dilemma  or  what?!  votes  below  :)
__label__0 is  disappointed  that  his  new  watch  did  not  come  in  a  heart-shaped  box.    cringe  i  know  but  i'm  bored  :(
__label__0 thinks  some  people  really  need  to  learn  to  act  their  age.
__label__0 will  engage  his  brain  before  asking  anyone  if  they  are  free  on  the  th  of  february  in  future  ://
__label__0 i  bought  it  today,  but  i  haven't  opened  it  yet.    actually,  i  probably  won't  get  to  it  for  another  few  days  since  i'll  be  so  busy  with  moving  and  setting  up  everything  else.
__label__0 i  belatedly  discovered  "my  so-called"  doppelganger  while  getting  my  s  tv  fix.
__label__1 guess  i  might  start  using  facebook  more  then...so  much  info  to  port  over.
__label__1 i  just  moved  everything  that  was  on  my  myspace  to  this  "wonderful"  site.  i  really  don't  even  know  why.  i  was  bored  maybe?  i  bet  i'll  hardly  ever  use  it.
__label__1 almost  killed  myself  trying  to  get  a  piece  of  non-existent  parchment  paper  from  my  spider  infested  basement.  also,  why  would  we  buy  amish  fruit  salad?  these  are  the  questions
__label__1 officially  hates  interpreting  poetry.
__label__1 bored...gonna  go  watch  thundercats  on  ".  exciting  evening,  eh?
__label__1 i  can  really  see  this  dislike  button  being  abused  for  very  ironic  purposes...  (now,  joy,  i  get  to  read  jane  eyre)
__label__1 in  the  process  of  trying  to  write  a  masterpiece!  (oh,  the  vanity)
__label__1 sleep...
__label__1 gonna  read  "shf"
__label__1 bought  "season  "  of  the  old  thundercats  cartoon;  watching  the  shit  out  of  this  old  nostalgic  favorite  right  now.  on  an  unrelated  note,  i  have  tons  of  homework.  looks  like  a  good  combination.
__label__1 apparently  i  read  better  while  listening  to  pink  floyd.  really  helps  with  stimulating  the  mind.
__label__1 anyone  have  a  need  or  desire  for  a  (formerly  stray)  red  tick  hound  dog?
__label__1 reading  "a  clockwork  orange",  and  then  on  to  "slaughter-house  five"...probably
__label__1 just  slept  from  am  to  pm  @_@.  woops
__label__1 new  (temporary)  dog  in  my  house.  concerned  about  worms,  for  his  sake  and  sparky's.
__label__1 what  an  ordeal  this  has  been.  this  dog  is  killing  me.  so  hard  to  keep  he  and  sparky  separated  too...
__label__1 parkour:  not  good  to  practice  in  the  house.
__label__1 the  french  have  redeemed  themselves  as  a  nationality  with  the  invention  of  parkour!
__label__1 i'm  going  to  sleep  out  of  pure  boredom.  goodbye  for  now,  conscious  world.
__label__1 just  passed  a  mensa  practice  exam.  did  a  litlte  worse  than  i  should  have,  due  to  having  misunderstood    or    questions,  and  one  seemed  like  a  trick.  i  feel  pretty  smart  right  now  nonetheless.
__label__1 putting  up  my  wonderfully  fake  tree.  it  has  given  me  joy  (read  as  pain//hatred)  for  the  past  four  years  now.  now  it  can  grace  my  livingroom  yet  again!
__label__1 another  day  gone...so  bored,  but  too  uninspired  to  do  anything  creative.  *sigh*  still  gotta  write  for  you  *propname*.  written  any  more  of  that?
__label__1 starting  from  chapter  one  and  going  from  there.  thank  you  *propname*!
__label__1 well,  this  poem  might,  loosely,  imitate  *propname*'s  poem...  not  sure  i  used  enough  imagery
__label__1 facebook  is  very  hard  to  navigate  with  everything  written  like  a  pirate.  i'll  just  have  to  adjust  :)
__label__1 mom  woke  me  up  today  at  noon;  i  was  a  little  peeved.  stayed  in  bed  for  about  ten  minutes  and  went:  oh  shit,  it's  christmas  isn't  it.  completely  forgot.
__label__1 what's  with  everyone  going  to  bed  so  early?  the  night  is  still  within  the  nadir.  the  last  remnants  of  the  day  remain  like  a  youthful  child  reluctant  to  mature.  carpe  noctem!
__label__1 sleep.  i  have  the  act  in  the  morning  after  all...
__label__1 just  found  a  word  for  word  modern  translation  of  othello;  hoorah,  hooray!
__label__1 is  listening  to  some  kickass  russian  hip-hop.  i  have  no  clue  what  they're  saying,  but  it's  awesome.
__label__1 watching  a  bunch  of  movies.  i'm  starting  with  "the  quiet  earth"
__label__1 wow,  already  a  two-hour  delay.
__label__1 why  so  early?  it  was  expected,  but  no  school  already?!  zippadee  zoodah,  zippadee  day...
__label__1 just  curious;  if  i'm  so  damn  annoying  with  my  vocabulary  and  ideas,  might  someone  tell  me  why  they  talk  to  me  exactly?
__label__1 yea,  so,  *propname*'s  reading  assignment...not  due  tomorrow.  just  letting  you  guys  know.
__label__0 what  is  this,  horseville?    because  i'm  surrounded  by  naysayers!
__label__0 i  have  no  phone!    the  iphone  .  os  upgrade  broke  my  phone.
__label__0 my  iphone  is  down  again
__label__1 meh.
__label__1 about  to  go  open  source  because  windows  is  <random  expletive>.
__label__1 free  hugs.
__label__1 writing,  writing,  writing,  writing  .  .  .  writing.
__label__1   revolutions  around  the  sun.  pretty  impressive  if  i  do  say  so  myself.
__label__1 books  are  great  company,  but  in  all  honesty,  my  apartment  is  getting  a  little  crowded.
__label__1 borderlands,  fantasy  novel  writing,  and  *propname*.  yeah,  it's  been  a  good  day.
__label__1 do  what  you  want  cause  a  pirate  is  free.  you  are  a  pirate!
__label__1 work  work  work.
__label__1 medication,  medication,  medication  .  .  .  science  fiction?  fighting  a  cold  can  be  interesing.
__label__1 suggested  song  lyrics:  i  want  to  be  an  interplanetary  business  man,  yeah,  bringing  discounts  to  the  farthest  star.  i  want  to  be  that  hyperspace  negotiator,  making  deals  on  jupiter  and  mars.
__label__1 this  is  not  relevant  to  my  interests.
__label__1 and  he  said,  "let  there  be  tacos!"  and  there  was.
__label__0 the  latest  and  newest  diet  plan  that  works!  its  in  the  news  http:////xs.md//kpv

__label__1 is  studying  to  take  the  nclex.  why  does  everyone  hate  on  wanting  to  do  nothing  with  your  life?  lol.  apparently  that  just  isn't  an  option.
__label__0 the  bike  home  for  lunch  is  rather  exhilarating  when  oversized  truck  make  right  turns  from  the  left  lane,  without  turn  signals.    at  least  do  it  when  the  light  is  green  maybe?
__label__0 finally  decided  on  a  new  name  for  kitty!  sassafras  :)
__label__0 sassafras  has  the  sniffles  :(
__label__0 is  so  glad  that  the  fire  alarm  will  save  us  from  excess  water  vapor.  .  .  from  the  dryer.    grrr.
__label__0 from  my  vet  school  app,  hours  i  have  spent  working  &  volunteering  with  animals  and  veterinarians:  
__label__0 marathon  on  the  square  at  pm  for  happy  hour?
__label__0 kitty  thinks  my  leg  is  fun  to  climb  up.    ow.    but  it's  hard  to  be  mad  when  the  purpose  of  the  climb  is  to  snuggle  with  me  :)
__label__0 is  kinda  glad  my  front  brake  is  now  functional,  otherwise  i  would  likely  have  been  squashed  by  a  little  yellow  car  today.
__label__0 just  got  a  kitten!!!    any  name  ideas  for  the  itty  bitty  kitty?
__label__0 mmmm.  .  .  cannibalism  day  in  my  dead  ppl  class  :)
__label__0 extends  special  thanks  to  *propname*  and  *propname*!    now  on  to  the  literature  review  ...
__label__0 is  enjoying  the  cricket...comfy  boxers  and  rainy  weather...is  it  too  soon  for  a  beer?
__label__0 can't  believe  that  her  son  walked  up  to  the  christmas  tree  stating  'j'.  i  was  a  little  confused  until  he  took  a  candy  cane  off  the  tree  and  proceeded  to  turn  it  upside  down  :-d
__label__0 got  home  from  shopping  all  evening  (*propname*  and  kids  in  tow)  and  then  wrapped  presents  all  night...and  it  still  isnt  finished...*yawn*
__label__0 -  so,  this  morning  *propname*  gets  up  to  play  and  he  goes  over  to  the  carpet  where  the  light  was  shining  through  the  blinds  casting  shadows...he  then  proceeds  to  tell  me  the  different  letters  the  sun  is  making  on  the  carpet...  'i',  't'  and  'l'  to  be  exact!  he  then  somehow  figured  out  how  to  cast  his  shadow  over  the  sun  to  make  the  letters  change  &  disappear!  at  this  rate,  he  will  be  smarter  than  me  before  he  goes  to  school!
__label__0 needs  beer...actually,  any  kind  of  alcohol  will  do...
__label__0 is  sick  of  being  sick!
__label__0 is  enjoying  the  cricket  but  has  no  fingernails  left.
__label__0 would  like  the  rain  back!
__label__0 had  a  great  day  yesterday  thanks  to  aunties  babysitting  :)
__label__0 i  did  the  macarena  with  a  pickle  at  the  dinner  table  because  the  voices  told  me  to.
__label__0 so...*propname*  can  now  count  backwards  from    :-)
__label__0 so...apparently,  according  to  urban  dictionary...a  women  named  *propname*  is  typically  very  beautiful  with  an  incredible  body  and  nice  eyes.  they  are  known  to  be  very  loveable.  *propname*  are  envied  by  other  women...haha...i  wish!
__label__1 preparing  the  different  meals  i  can  eat  for  my  "bulking"  diet  with  my  custom  workout  program  starting  tuesday.  in  theory  this  should  be  better  than  px,  hit,  x,  etc.  counting  calories  is  tedious,  but  it's  the  best  way  to  make  real  progress.
__label__1 exit  silicon  valley,  enter  silicone  valley
__label__1 finally  saw  avatar  in  imax  d  last  night,  simply  amazing!

__label__1 i  haven't  opened  the  blinds  yet  but  from  the  sound  of  the  wind  and  the  rain  i  think  that  the  world  may  be  about  to  end...
__label__1 is  bloody  freezing....
__label__1 thanks  everyone  for  all  the  texts  etc...    finally  feeling  human  again!    i  don't  think  i've  ever  been  so  sick.    went  out  for  the  first  time  in    days  this  morning!  talk  about  cabin  fever...    back  to  work  on  wednesday  -  am  even  looking  forward  to  it!

__label__1 "all  the  old  bindings  are  broken.  cosmological  centers  now  are  anywhere  and  everywhere.  the  earth  is  a  heavenly  body,  most  beautiful  of  all,  and  all  poetry  now  is  archaic  that  fails  to  match  the  wonder  of  this  view."  -  *propname*,  *myths  to  live  by*

__label__0 i  was  totally  freaked  out  tonight  while  driving  home  with  janice  at  am.  the  black  coupe  next  to  me  matched  my  speed  even  though  i  was  going  fast  and  then  he  continued  to  match  me  speed  as  i  slowed  down.  so  i  turn  to  look  at  the  driver  of  the  car  and  he's  wearing  a  mask.  a  rubber  mask  reminiscent  to  freddy  cruger.  _  i  almost  had  a  heart  attack.  i  then  slowed  down  a  lot  and  he  continued  on...  oh  my  goodness...
__label__0 in  my    min  stop  at  *c  bakery  in  irvine,  i  saw    people  i  knew...
__label__0 then  at  costco  tonight,  i  find  out  my  atm  card  is  blocked  due  to  potential  fraud.  now  i  need  to  stop  by  the  bank  tomorrow  for  a  temporary  card...  i  wonder  if  this  qualifies  for  fml...
__label__0 quite  possibly  the  worst  couple  days  ever:  yesterday  almost  cried  at  work.  i  apparently  have  the    worst  classes  in  the  school-  lowest  freshman  math.  who  i  see  for  four  periods.    and  which  stole  a  student's  wallet.

__label__1 question:  what  would  have  happened  if  adam  and  eve  had  eaten  from  the  "tree  of  life"  before  eating  from  the  "tree  of  knowledge"?
__label__1 i  think  *propname*  is  quite  a  little  beuity.
__label__1 i'm  ecstatic!  i  just  spoke  briefly  with  *propname*'s  lawyer.  based  on  some  "case  files"  i  emailed  her,  we  have  enough  evidence  to  prove  cps's  removal  of  the  kids  was  illegal  and  grounds  for  an  emergency  hearing.  we  believe  we  have  enough  evidence  to  cost  both  cps  and  humble  pd  their  "qualified  immunity",  allowing  us  to  file  a  civil  suit  against  them  and  the  apartments.  anyone  know  a  good  civil  attorney???
__label__1 *propname*'s  kids  won  in  kbxx-.  "madd  hatta's  elves"  christmas  contest.  they  get  to  go  to  an  invitation  only  christmas  party  at  dave  &  busters  monday  morning.  unfortunately.  *propname*'s  daddy  does  not  want  to  let  him  go  because  of  all  the  cps  stuff.
__label__1 things  went  better.  *propname*  was  able  to  retain  her  composur  and  not  break  down  in  court.  the  judge  referred  the  case  to  "mediation".  we  go  to  that  jan  th.
__label__1 lord  willing  and  with  his  blessing.  i  claim  in  the  name  of  jesus:  "today  we  get  the  kids  back."  all  prayers  are  welcome.
__label__1 please  keep  *propname*'s  family  in  your  prayers  tonight  and  tomorrow.  we  have  to  be  in  court  at  am.  really  pray  for  the  oldest  *propname*  went  to  his  dad's  for  his  summer  visit  and  had  his  mother,  brother  and  sister  stripped  from  him  for  six  months.  cps  is  providing  christmas  for  the  other  two  but  not  him.    i  sure  hope  we  succeed  at  stripping  them  of  their  "immunity"  and  make  them  pay  for  what  they've  done  to  this  family.
__label__1 i  stopped  by  and  visited  with  *propname*  and  *propname*.  only  stayed  about  twenty  minutes.  i  sure  will  be  glad  when  they  can  come  back  home.
__label__1 well  we  are  on  hold  until  next  wed.  both  casa  and  cps  are  demanding  current  prescription  records  all  though  they  have  through  the  last  court  date  and  did  not  request  these  until  yesterday.  *propname*'s  theropist  did  not  show  either,  but  he  is  being  supenaed  for  wed.
__label__1 *propname*  just  told  me  tuesday,  that  her  cancer  has  progressed  to  stage  .
__label__1 could  teenage  "huffing"  be  the  result  of  modern  day  child  proofing  and  the  parent  neglecting  to  actually  teach  the  child,  "that  will  kill  you".
__label__1 can  anyone  out  there  tell  me  if  jesus  was  ever  anointed  in  oil?  he  was  babtized  in  water  and  anointed  in  the  holy  spirt  which  is  why  he  is  called  the  "anointed  one".  can  anyone  tell  me  yes  or  no.  if  yes  i  need  scripture  reference.  thank  you.
__label__1 go  gators!    and  ....  now,  lets  see  if  the  vols  help  us  clench  the  sec  east  :)  oh,  and  happy  halloween!!!
__label__1 enjoyed  the  football  and  fun  of  the  weekend,  and  now  its  back  to  reality.
__label__1 i  love  mondays....  can  every  one  grasp  the  sarcasm  in  that  statement.  i  hope  so.
__label__1 i  don't  understand  why  some  people  make  it  so  hard  for  you  to  be  nice  to  them.  i  dont  understand  why  i'm  worrying  about  it  anyway,  they  sure  aren't.
__label__1 thanksgiving  cooking!  fun  or  stressful,  i'll  decide  later.
__label__1 its  friday!
__label__1 to  my  veteran  friends,  family,  and  strangers  alike;  i  would  like  to  say  thank  you.  thank  you  for  the  sacrifices  you  have  made  for  my  safety,  my  freedoms,  and  my  country.  god  bless  you  all.
__label__1 just  can't  get  into  the  monay  state  of  mind.
__label__1 who  can  tell  me  how  to  not  be  a  fan  of  something  anymore?
__label__1 i  don't  want  to  get  sick,  but  i  think  it's  happening  anyway  :(
__label__1 can't  decided  if  she  is  going  to  jacksonville  saturday  or  not.
__label__1 hooray!  home  from  work.
__label__1 what  was  lsu  thinking?
__label__1 do  you  remember  that  song  "break  stuff"  by  limp  bizkit?  thats  kind  of  the  day  i'm  having.
__label__1 back  to  work.  trying  to  get  everything  cleaned  up  before  the  new  year.  if  you  saw  my  desk,  you  would  understand  why  i  am  starting  now  :)
__label__1 merry  christmas!
__label__1 people  should  not  encourage  me  to  drink  until    o'clock  in  the  morning  :(

__label__1 i'm  getting  calls  back  on  my  resume,  it  makes  me  hopefull  i  will  find  the  right  job  :)
__label__1 i  just  can't  get  into  the  swing  of  things  today.
__label__1 what  sad  news  for  the  gator  nation  today,  the  resignation  of  urban  meyer.  our  prayers  will  be  with  coach  meyer  and  his  family.
__label__1 upon  what  basis  do  we  judge  other  people?  is  it  ithe  experiances  that  we  ourselves  have,  or  the  belifes  in  which  we  hold?
__label__1 is  unemployed,  and  thinks  its  a  good  thing  :)
__label__1 i  know  many  people  have  faced  this  issue  before,  but  mit  graduate  admissions  should  stop  denying  the  existence  of  caltech...
__label__1 according  to  a  certain  oil//gas  industry  recruiter,  .  <  ..
__label__1 it's  creepy  how  facebook  suggests  that  a  certain  friend  has  too  few  friends.
__label__1 it's  really  irksome  when  a  grad  school  application  recognizes  'california  institute  of  locksmithing'  but  not  'california  institute  of  technology.'
__label__1 contra  costa  county  is  now  recruiting  prison  cooks  at  caltech.    i  didn't  know  they  needed  prison  cooks  that  badly.    besides,  there's  probably  a  .  gpa  requirement  somewhere...
__label__1 we  consider  a  pure  gas  composed  of  rigid,  nonattracting  spherical  molecules  of  diameter  d  and  mass  m,  and  the  number  density  (number  of  molecules  per  unit  volume)  is  taken  to  be  n.
__label__1 apparently  "california  institute  of  technology"  is  too  long  a  name  for  mit  graduate  admissions.
__label__1 the  moral  of  ninja  assassins:  if  you're  ever  attacked  by  black  pajama-clad  assassins,  your  only  chance  of  survival  is  riding  in  a  volkswagen  eos.
__label__1 just  realized  that  it's  cheaper  to  run  his  car  on  lard  in  texas  ($.//gallon)  than  on  diesel  ($.//gallon)  in  the  uk.
__label__1 i  love  how  techers  are  always  tagged  as  "the  smart  one."
__label__1 told  the  guy  behind  the  fish  counter  to  gut  a  catfish  by  mimicing  longitudinal  write  slices.
__label__1 fun(  baiting  russian  trolls)  >  fun(  baiting  generic  trolls)
__label__1 what's  this  song  i'm  hearing  on  the  radio  with  sirens,  screams  and  gunshots?    oh  right,  it's  "santa  claus  is  coming  to  town."
__label__1 good  thing  caltech  doesn't  have  a  front  gate;  otherwise,  someone  would  write  "wirklichkeit  macht  frei"  on  top.
__label__1 my  family  now  has    car//person,  down  from  .  cars//person.
__label__1 the  aeropress  is  back  in  business.    america,  fuck  yeah!
__label__1 //.    finally  done.
__label__1 my    *propname*  has  a  ridiculously  sharp  throttle  response.    i  wonder  if  it  has  anything  to  do  with  the  unintended  acceleration  problems...
__label__1 wonders  why  engineers  are  overrepresented  in  terrorist  organizations.
__label__1 mass  effect  :  it's  nice  to  see  that  the  nigerian    scam  is  still  going  strong  in  ,  this  time  with  batarians  trying  to  recover  quarantined  prothean  artifacts.
__label__1 i  don't  know  why  new  car  dealers  in  houston  insist  on  all-season  tires  on  all  their  products.    we  have  snow  one  day  every    years!
__label__1 note  to  'the  wildlife  fund':  fuck  you,  stop  pestering  me  about  your  $  'donation'  to  my  nonexistent  'zoo'.
__label__1 dear  bioware:  dragon  age  is  a  wonderful  and  entertaining  game,  but  epic  fail  on  the  load  times.    at  least  make  the  wait  entertaining.    instead  of  blood  tracks  on  a  map  (or  awkward  elevator  rides),  how  about  a  d  hack  'n  slash  minigame?
__label__1 southern  rap:  oh,  the  amazing  things  you  can  do  with  a  minimalist  palette  of  shouts,  chants,  and  grunts.
