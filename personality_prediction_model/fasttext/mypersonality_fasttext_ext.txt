__label__0 back
__label__0 rip  open  the  diseased  heart  of  a  corporation  and  what  spills  out?  -on  people
__label__0 you're  wicked  overseer
__label__0 "keep  government  away  from  my  medicare!"    as  good  a  summary  of  american  politics  as  one  is  likely  to  get  these  days.
__label__0 turn  your  lamp  down  low.
__label__0 holy.  fuck.  http:////www.youtube.com//watch?v=ypjgzdfrps

__label__0 "i  find  it  absolutely  appalling  that  anyone  could  believe  that  political  affiliation  would  be  used  to  determine  who  receives  medical  treatment.  that's  what  race  and  socioeconomic  standing  are  for."
__label__0 thanks  folks.
__label__0 what  the  fuck,  steelers?
__label__0 in  other  news,  the  steelers  th  quarter  is  the  most  depressing  thing  of  all  time.
__label__0 suppose  you  were  an  idiot.  and  suppose  you  were  a  member  of  congress.  but  i  repeat  myself.
__label__0 bush  was  a  symptom,  not  a  cause.
__label__0 the  bridge  is  over?
__label__0 fuckin'  *propname*
__label__0 speech  is  my  hammer
__label__0 [the  "liberal  media"]  love  to  be  denounced  from  the  right,  and  the  right  loves  to  denounce  them,  because  that  makes  them  look  like  courageous  defenders  of  freedom  and  independence  while,  in  fact,  they  are  imposing  all  of  the  presuppositions  of  the  propaganda  system.-chomsky
__label__0 stop  the  violence  and  start  the  revolution-talib
__label__0 when  i  give  food  to  the  poor,  they  call  me  a  saint.    when  i  ask  why  the  poor  have  no  food,  they  call  me  a  communist.-*propname*
__label__0 the  best  argument  against  democracy  is  a  five-minute  conversation  with  the  average  voter.
__label__0 what  i  didn't  want:  more  characters  on  heroes.
__label__0 and  until  peoples  learn  to  spot  the  fanning  of  mass  emotions  and  the  sowing  of  bitterness,  suspicion,  and  intolerance  as  crimes  in  themselves  -  as  perhaps  the  greatest  disservice  that  can  be  done  to  the  cause  of  popular  government  -  this  sort  of  thing  will  continue  to  occur.
__label__0 thank  you,  *propname*,  for  still  being  on  the  ballot  so  that  stupid  people  could  vote  for  you.
__label__0 "how  impious  is  the  title  of  sacred  majesty  applied  to  a  worm,  who  in  the  midst  of  his  splendor  is  crumbling  into  dust!"-*propname*.    they  don't  make  writers  like  they  used  to.

__label__0 "britain's  desire  to  be  a  big  player  on  the  world  stage  has  delivered  huge  benefits  including  being  dragged  into  a  series  of  catastrophic  wars  with  america's  throbbing  tumescence  lodged  firmly  at  the  back  of  our  throat,  while  at  the  same  time  being  unable  to  afford  decent  roads,  railways,  schools  and  hospitals.  it's  what  we  call  a  'win-win'."

__label__0 why  do  you  insist  that  the  human  genetic  code  is  "sacred"  or  "taboo"?  it  is  a  chemical  process  and  nothing  more.  for  that  matter  -we-  are  chemical  processes  and  nothing  more.  if  you  deny  yourself  a  useful  tool  simply  because  it  reminds  you  uncomfortably  of  your  mortality,  you  have  uselessly  and  pointlessly  crippled  yourself.  chairman  *propname*,  "looking  god  in  the  eye"

__label__0 face  the  facts.  then  act  on  them.  it's  the  only  mantra  i  know,  the  only  doctrine  i  have  to  offer  you,  and  it's  harder  than  you'd  think,  because  i  swear  humans  seem  hardwired  to  do  anything  but.  face  the  facts.  don't  pray,  don't  wish,  don't  buy  into  centuries-old  dogma  and  dead  rhetoric.  don't  give  in  to  your  conditioning  or  your  visions  or  your  fucked-up  sense  of...  whatever.  face  the  facts.  then  act.
__label__0 stability  means  we  run  it.  there  are  countries  that  are  very  stable.  cuba  is  stable,  but  that�s  not  called  stability.

__label__0 *propname*  was  ejected  from  the  new  york  state  senate,  which  is  good,  because  he  slashed  his  girlfriend  with  a  knife.

__label__1 is  creating  a  linkedin  account,  as  if  she  didn't  already  have  too  many  networking  accounts  to  keep  track  of!
__label__1 i,  i'm  thinking  it's  a  sign  that  the  freckles  in  our  eyes  are  mirror  images,  and  when  we  kiss  they're  perfectly  aligned  and  i  have  to  speculate  that  god  himself  did  make  us  into  corresponding  shapes  like  puzzle  pieces  from  the  clay
__label__1 is  at  work...  yay.
__label__1 thinks  she  will  keep  this  as  her  profile  pic  until  those  tan  lines  fade,  if  that  ever  happens.

__label__1 is  hungry.
__label__1 needs  to  suck  it  up.
__label__1 due  to  a  lack  of  anyone  being  interested  in  my  life  updates,  i  will  write  here  and  delude  myself  that  someone  wiill  read  it  later  and  actually  care...    got  a  new  phone  yesterday:  a  palm  treo.    had  to  pay  $  a  mo  extra  to  use  it,  but  now  i'll  be  able  to  use  the  interwebz  while  in  white  bluff.      dollars  is  a  fair  price  to  put  on  cabin  fever  prevention.  maybe  i  should  tweet  this  too.  :p
__label__1 *propname*  made  it  up  to  me  today...  after  i  waited  for  her  for  a  half  hour  past  our  appointment  time.  sheesh.  but  *propname*  was  awesome  enough  to  let  me  have  some  hot  chocolate  :)

__label__1 that  is  a  problem.  that  is  not  trusting  the  nowness  properly  that  what  is  the  actual  experience  now  possesses  a  lot  of  powerful  things.  it  is  so  powerful  that  we  can't  face  it.  therefore,  we  have  to  borrow  from  the  past  and  invite  the  future  all  the  time.  maybe  that's  why  we  seek  religion.  maybe  that's  why  we  march  in  the  street.  maybe  that's  why  we  complain  to  society.  maybe  that's  why  we  vote  for  the  presidents.
__label__1 can't  sleep  because  the  dog    keeps  barking  at  something  in  the  yard  and  its  kinda  freakin  me  out
__label__1 rediscovered  an  old  journal  and  some  old  poetry  of  hers  and  is  spending  the  day  pondering  who  she  is  and  who  her  real  friends  are                                                        .......  bed  rest  has  given  me  a  lot  of  time  to  think  lol  *<:~)
__label__1 i  find  it  interesting  that  i  cannot  reply  to  comments  on  *propname*'s  page  without  entering  my  phone  number.  a  neighbor  of  mine  received  threatening  calls  from  a  conservative  group  after  voicing  her  opinion  at  a  rally.  how  they  got  her  number  i  do  not  know  but  i  wonder  if  the  same  would  have  happened  to  me  if  i  entered  my  number...  scary  stuff

__label__1 how  can  i  be  expected  to  work  when  there  is  so  much  fun  puddle  jumping  to  be  done?
__label__1 a  simple  smile  can  change  a  day,  an  understanding  look  can  say  "i  know  exactly  how  you  feel."  but  we  have  learned  to  build  our  walls,  so  very  strong  and  very  tall,  for  fear  of  what  the  world  might  steal

__label__0 can  someone  explain  to  me  how  keith  can  misspell  "beginner"  and  "hear"  but  can  then  use  asphyxia  correctly  in  a  sentence?
__label__0 it's  :  and  i'm  still  awake.    i  hate  myself  sometimes
__label__0 if  i  can  write  a  screenplay  in  two  days  i  can  submit  it  to  a  festival.    fat  chance  of  that
__label__0 um,  mother  nature  .  .  .  i  love  thunderstorms  as  much  as  the  next  person,  but  this  is  the  rd  one  today.    could  you  get  your  shit  together?    thank  you.
__label__0 i  am  now  replacing  my  highly  original  baseball  status  with  one  about  women's  tennis:  jelena  jankovic  thinks  she's  the  number  one  tennis  player?    i'd  love  to  try  whatever  she's  on
__label__0 "if  your  friend  got  assassined,  how  would  you  respond"  .  .  .  probably  with:  that  doesn't  even  make  sense

__label__0 going  to  your  cousin's  wedding?    awesome.    going  to  legend's  bar  afterwards?    not.

__label__0 if  cavemen  and  astronauts  got  into  a  fight,  who  would  win?
__label__0 who  called  me  today  and  left  a  voicemail?

__label__0 that  noise  you    heard  at  approximately  :  est  was  keith  puking.    it  might  have  sounded  like  a  black  hole  opening,  or  a  monster  being  stabbed  to  death,  or  any  number  of  things,  but  it  was  just  keith.    the  more  you  know  *star  wipe

__label__1 knows  that  a  burning  smell  isn't  the  best  sign  of  good  cooking  and  is  thus  going  to  turn  the  heat  down
__label__1 is  happy  because  he  saw  a  lot  of  friends  from  stafford  on  saturday  night  and  made  a  big  bonfire!
__label__1 thinks  it  is  very  cold  to  go  out  in  shorts  and  t-shirt  but  is  going  running  anyway!
__label__1 the  soup:  the  verdict  type:  vegetable  appearance:  fantastic  texture:  good  taste:  poor  overall:  edible  but  not  pleasant  summary:  this  is  a  great  soup  for  looking  at,  it  is  full  of  colour,  healthy  vegetables  and  creaminess!  if  you  are  not  hungry  make  this  soup  and  you  will  feel  good!  however,  if  eating  is  your  thing,  this  soup  should  be  avoided.  i  have  soup  left  for    meals  -  any  takers?  only  p&p  to  pay!  enjoy!
__label__1 found  that  you  can  tell  roughly  where  you  are  on  the  canal  by  the  accents  of  the  people  who  say  hello!
__label__1 has  just  attended  his  first  parish  council  meeting!
__label__1 regrets  that  he  might  have  to  dispose  of  his  pumpkin  (*propname*)  as  he  is  becoming  a  little  furry  and  wonders  if  giving  him  a  quick  shave  might  do  the  job
__label__1 is  now  a  graduate
__label__1 has  a  huge  pile  of  washing!
__label__1 why  doesn't  social  interview  ask  me  any  questions...  i  feel  very  left  out.  :(
__label__1 hasn't  been  outside  yet  today  but  is  now  going  to  post  a  letter  to  one  lucky  recipient!
__label__1 is  it  just  me  or  does  anyone  else  feel  in  the  mood  for  an  abba  sing  along  session?
__label__1 is  missing  katie
__label__1 realised  at  around    last  night  that  he  had  nothing  to  offer  to  trick-or-treaters  so  he  made  toffee...  but  then  nobody  came.
__label__1 is  soon  to  become  a  member  of  the  con  club!!  whoop!
__label__1 no  longer  has  a  huge  pile  of  washing
__label__1 doesn't  know  where  anyone  is!
__label__1 what  a  busy  morning!  we  had  a  plumber,  the  cleaner  a  dog  walker  and  the  gardener  all  around  all  at  same  time!
__label__1 is  wondering  how  much  tiffin  cake  he  needs  to  eat  to  get  one  of  his  five  a  day  fruit  portions
__label__1 thinks  d  glasses  make  the  world  a  little  bit  more  fun!
__label__1 last  night  i  went  to  a  conference  where  the  police  were  asking  us  to  pray  for  them.  lets  pray  for  the  police  and  our  communities.  god  moves  when  his  people  pray.
__label__1 apologises  if  he  appears  to  be  shouting  or  talking  very  loudly  to  people  at  the  moment.  he's  getting  used  to  talking  to  someone  who  is  hard  of  hearing  but  keeps  forgetting  to  talk  normally  to  other  people.
__label__1 wants  to  know  if  anyone  has  borrowed  an  elf  costume  off  him
__label__1 is  talking  to  *propname*  :d
__label__1 is  off  to  practice  being  a  shepherd
__label__1 has  been  put  on  hold  but  is  enjoying  (dancing  to)  the  music!  :d
__label__1 is  moving  yet  more  wood!
__label__1 yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay  snooooooooooooooow!
__label__1 may  have  just  slipped  over  on  the  ice  but  thinks  he  got  away  with  it  by  making  it  look  like  he  was  break  dancing...
__label__1 is  heading  home  for  christmas!
__label__1 may  have  eaten  a  few  too  many  sweets  today...
__label__1 is  fighting  to  make  it  to  the  table  football  semis
__label__1 finds  it  highly  amusing  that  we  are  currently  bringing  the  milk  inside  to  warm  it  up  in  the  fridge!
__label__1 is  about  to  start  wrapping  christmas  presents!
__label__1 is  no  longer  talking  to  *propname*  -  but  not  in  a  bad  way.  just  because  it  is  impractical  and  expensive  to  talk  on  the  phone  continuously  and  because  we  both  needed  to  do  things.
__label__0 writing,  then    chapters  homework,  then  bed.  or  just  loveline  ?
__label__0 my  mind  is  so  confusing,  it's  scary.
__label__0 i  just....i  can't  do  this  without  family...friends.  anybody  ?
__label__0 getting  together  map,  snacks,  music,  and  up-all-night  accessories  for  hollywood.  will  starting  driving  at    am.
__label__0 loveline,  pills,  and  a  kitty.  best  combo  ever.  night.
__label__0 fucking  hell,  grrrr....
__label__0 gah,  head's  pounding.  i  wish  i  wasn't  in  so  much  pain.  it  makes  the  pills  that  much  more  tempting...
__label__0 okay,  so  what  are  the  different  plans  for  friday  night  in  la  ?  there's  *propname*...?
__label__0 some  people  say  pain  can  be  controlled  by  the  mind.  i  do  not  agree  with  these  people.  it  doesn't  mean  i  don't  admire  them  though.
__label__0 doctors  seem  to  want  me  to  sit  out.  in  a  wheelchair...no  fucking  way.  i'd  rather  walk  down  the  street  with  tears  streaming,  than  be  benched....which,  unfortunately,  is  not  too  far  off.
__label__0 well  anyway,  fuck  it.  i'm  gonna  die  young  but  happy.  rather  than  healthy  and  old.
__label__0 gonna  be    degree  today  !  coffee,  sunshine,  and  sweet  email  from  a  friend.  day  started  with  love,  is  continuing,  and  will  end  in  love.
__label__0 home...finally.  sooooo  tired...gonna  get  a  couple  hours  before  work  starts  up  again.
__label__0 alright,  recharged  as  it  were.  if  this  is  a  night  of  no  dark  dreams;  you  are  a  miracle  worker  too.
__label__0 easy  to  read;  i  like  that  !
__label__0 sleeeeeeeeeep......
__label__0 i  find  i'm  enjoying  tiny  poetry.    such  as:  rain-  my  ears  hear  a  drip,  drop,  splash  it's  more  of  a  scream,  laugh,  live  and  you  make  it  so  hard  not  to  be  cliche.  you  pile  on  my  dreams,    like  power  lines  on  a  sky.  is  it  raining  where  you  are  ?
__label__0 not  tired,  must  sleep.  long  week  ahead,  and  no  weekend.  friday  is  no  longer  a  day  off.  sore  all  over,  but  i  asked  for  it.  cig,  loveline,  sleep...smile,  love,  remember.
__label__0 today  was  a  much  needed  day  off  !!  back  to  a  fake  smile  tomorrow,  but  rejuvinated  by  friends  tonight.
__label__0 it's  moments  like  this  that  i  wish  i  worked  for  walmart.  i  hate  rape.  i'm  no  good  at  counseling  "victims".  especially  when  it's  a  parental  perpetrator.  why  is  this  the  way  of  the  world  ?  why  is  it  reality  ?
__label__0 blah  !  work  lots,  need  money.  not  worth  it  really.  i'm  loosing  the  happiness  !!
__label__0 sore  throat  starting  out.  tempted  to  gargle  vodka,  but  must  get  some  work  done.
__label__0 frustrated  beyond  all  hell,  blog  isn't  helping.
__label__0 "i've  been  high,  and  i've  been  down,  my  head  in  the  clouds  and  my  hands  on  the  ground.  "
__label__0 i  think  i  would  be  dead  without  my  heating  pad.  i  am  completely  serious.
__label__0 i  don't  know  where  my  mind  is  in  this  moment.  it's  so  fleeting;  emotion.  i'm  so  tired,  but  i  can't  sleep.  and  like  *propname*  says,  a  shotgun  just  leaves  a  messed  up  wall.    ah  well.  random  thoughts.  better  go  to  bed  before  that  crap  goes  deeper.
__label__0 gah,  headache.  okay  my  body's  failing  me;  i'm  going  to  put  off  work  'til  tomorrow  and  take  care  of  myself  now.  ice  cream,  giant  sweater,  warm  bed...i'm  comin'.
__label__0 okay,  people,  seriously..."lol"  is  so  blood  annoying  when  you  use  it  on  every  line.
__label__0 fuck.  okay,  file  another  tragic  story  in  a  box  of  my  mind  to  be  dealt  with  when  i  no  longer  have  a  heart.  wonder  how  much  longer  it'll  take...not  too  long  now.
__label__0 okay,  i'm  no  good  at  positivity  right  now.  that's  my  work  "hat".  so  sue  me.
__label__0 ah  coffee....makes  the  world  go  'round.
__label__0 i  feel  emptied  out;  please  rain  down  on  me...darkness  and  light,  come  fill  me  up.
__label__0 okay,  must  sleep.  must  work  in  mere  hours...ah  who  am  i  kidding  ?  i  don't  sleep.  or  eat.  just  smoke...and  work.  and  love.
__label__0 got  the  new  iphone  gs.  don't  ask  how,  i  won't  tell  you.  but  thank  you.
__label__0 "i  like  my  chicken  fried,  a  cold  beer  on  a  friday  night,  a  pair  of  jeans  that  fit  just  right,  and  the  radio  up  !"
__label__0 qtd:  "'flower'  usually  refers  to  a  vulva  in  general,  not  virginity  or  'cherry  popping'  as  the  kids  would  say."  hahahaha
__label__0 "little  red  bird  under  a  chair,  waiting  for  the  crumbs  to  fall.  daddy  said,  'get  a  job'.  well  don't  you  see,  daddy,  how  good  i  am  at  catching  crumbs  ?"
__label__0 aggrevated  that  i  let  someone  else  take  me  from  really  happy  to  hurt  and  depressed.  it's  on  me  to  change  my  reaction  to  be  one  of  loveful  me.
__label__0 i  need  to  be  asleep.  i  get  up  in....  hrs  ?  no  idea  really.  what  am  i  doing  again  ?
__label__0 "for  a  moment  i  love  everything  i  see  and  think  and  feel..."
__label__0 "walking  by  the  river  i...reach  my  hands  to  cup  the  sky.  it  runs  down  my  arms...a  bitter  blue.  turn  to  red,  and  the  gashes  grew."  god,  this  song...every  word  is  raw  and  honest.
__label__0 i  am  what  i  make  of  myself.  i  am  love.  i  am.
__label__0 i  wish  i  was  in  nyc  and  seeing  *propname*  tomorrow  night....
__label__0 i  need  to  go  back  to  my  live  food  diet.  not  %  like  before,  but  i  bet  i  could  do  %  without  losing  too  much  weight..
__label__0 it's  ugly  here.  but  there  are  sparks...moments.  love.
__label__0 i  guess  it  all  depends  on  your  mood...why  can't  these  meds  be  any  damn  good  ?
__label__0 "i  believe  in  love.  it's  just  my  heart  that  keeps  turning  me  down.  i  believe  in  love,  i  think  it's  just  fine."
__label__0 i  always  want  the  blog  to  be  the  magical  valve.  turn  it  on,  write,  be  healed.  it  never  is  though.  and  now  i  still  hurt,  i  just  feel  more  raw  now.  as  long  as  i  stay  with  the  emotion  and  don't  deny...i'll  be  alright.
__label__0 fucking  musicians.  fuck  musicians...
__label__0 <
__label__0 now  that  i'm  done  writing,  i  need  food...hmmm....
__label__0 i  did  that  shit  with  spasms,  and  after    shots  of  espresso  today.  who  da  man  ??  beauty  school,  here  i  come...right  after  this  next  criminal  minds.  <
__label__0 i  have  to  find  the  superhero  i  use  to  be.  i  can't  bring  myself  to  believe  it  was  just  the  love  of  a  silly  boy  that  did  it.
__label__0 (breast  cancer  awareness  question  -  what  colour  bra  are  you  wearing  ?)  no  colour.  i'm  not  a  fan  of  bras  lately.  but  this  is  a  stupid  fb  idea.  it  doesn't  really  raise  awareness  unless  you  also  say  what  the  hell  it's  about  !    stupid,  stupid.
__label__0 my  most  awesome  friend  just  surprise-attacked  me  with  a  present  of  a  dark  chocolate  bacon  bar...drool.  best.  moment.  ever.
__label__0 again,  my  company  and  night  are  ruined  by  some  physical  ailment  of  mine.  i  am  fucking  tired  of  it.
__label__0 wow,  fresh  air.  crazy.  good  day  sunshine,  you're  my  favourite  star.
__label__0 okay,  sleep.  dreaming  of  bacon  and  dark  chocolate.  mmmm....
__label__0 to  be  something  i  am  not...that  is  what  i'll  be  when  i  grow  up.  god,  it'll  be  stunning.
__label__0 okay.  maybe  not  sleep.
__label__0 pain  is  a  bitch.
__label__0 got  called  in  to  work  tomorrow.  at  least  i  don't  have  to  run  groups.  bed  early  tonight.
__label__0 wow  been  a  tiring  and  painful  day.  gonna  set  up  a  movie  and  try  to  relax.  love  to  all  of  my  beautiful  friends  and  family  for  the  support  and  awesomeness  of  who  they  are.  and  a  high  five  to  my  surgeon  who  is  the  man  and  gives  me  hope  of  having  a  less  painful  life.  <  you  all.  you  make  me  happy,  yes  you.

__label__0 having  surgery  today.  i  can't  wait  to  be  in  hospital.  i'm  not  a  big  fan  of  surgery.  but  hospitals  feel  like  home  to  me.  calming  in  the  chaos.
__label__0 reading  an  amazing  book  called  stranger  in  a  strange  land.  now  i'm  listening  to  loveline  and  trying  to  rest  for  the  god-aweful  full  day  tomorrow.

__label__0 "*propname*  teaches  trying?"  *propname*,  sometimes  in  your  ceaseless  effort  to  provide  a  slightly  more  depressing  take  on  various  topics,  you  come  up  with  a  bit  of  a  stretch.
__label__0 hi  chicago,  what's  up

__label__0 every  time  i  log  in  to  something  and  i  see  one  of  those  checkboxes  next  to  the  words  "remember  me,"  i  can't  help  but  think  -  ever  so  briefly  -  "but  ahhhhh,  for-r-ge-et  my  faaate."

__label__0 it's  pretty  amazing  how  many  hours  are  required  to  organize  a  presentation  that  is  going  to  last  no  more  than  twenty  minutes.  this  would  be  so  much  simpler  if  i  could  just  call  haydn  as  a  witness.
__label__0 i  finally  went  grocery  shopping.  picked  up  a  small  piece  of  raclette,  not  knowing  what  it  was,  because  i  wanted  something  to  put  on  crackers.  turns  out  it  is  supposed  to  be  melted  over  a  flame  or  special  grill  and  then  immediately  scraped  onto  some  kind  of  bread.  whyyyy  did  i  get  such  a  difficult  cheese?  will  just  putting  it  right  on  a  pan  or  toasting  it  somehow  work?  i  guess  we'll  see!

__label__1 i  have    cliques  in  my  facebook  network.

__label__0 is  feeling  a  little  subbydub  today.
__label__0 has  a  new  baby  sister!    little  baby  no-name!
__label__0 just  found  an  organization  called  think  before  you  speak  that  flips  out  about  people  saying,  "that's  gay,"  claiming  that  it's  offensive.    that's  pretty  gay,  if  you  ask  me.                                                                                                                                                                        
__label__0 there  is  now  officially  a  tea-growing  subbydub  ocean,  according  to  *propname*.

__label__0 s  epic  wound  is  starting  to  heal!    yay!
__label__0 has  only    more  days  to  use  the  government's  money.    anyone  want  me  to  go  run  the  water  and  waste  some  more  of  their  money?    got  any  grudges?      ;)
__label__0 can't  remember  the  name  of  that  agility  school  in  wv  and  can't  find  it  on  the  internet!    anyone  else  remember?    dad  or  mj?
__label__0 is  in  valdosta  tomorrow,  then  to  st.  augustine  saturday,  then  back  to  valdosta  sunday,  and  back  home  to  charleston  sunday,  too.
__label__0 just  scrubbed  the  inside  of  the  car.    in  the  dark.    with  the  mosquitoes.
__label__0 just  got  back  from  the  pool.    wow,  i'm  exhausted...
__label__0 stayed  up  to  finish  the  kite  runner  last  night,  probably  around  four  in  the  morning.    i'm  not  sure  because  i  don't  have  a  clock  up  there!  lol
__label__0 just  finished  "there  are  no  children  here."    it  was  horrendous.
__label__0 s  little  sister  told  her  that  she  could  "ride  her  tricycle  with  no  handlebars."    as  long  as  you  don't  start  singing  their  more  political  songs,  sweetie.    :p
__label__0 just  planned  the  perfect  field  trip.  ^^
__label__0 spent    hour  in  the  car,    hours  in  potomac  mills,  only  went  to    stores,  and  got  just  a  cup  out  of  the  whole  day.    wow.
__label__0 is  going  to  try  drawing  upstairs.    didn't  work  so  well  in  the  car.    usually  a  change  of  atmosphere  helps.
__label__0 the  early  bird  gets  the  worm...but  the  second  mouse  gets  the  cheese  in  the  trap.    words  to  live  by.    i  do,  at  least.
__label__0 just  got  back  from  the  zoo.    no  gray  wolves,  no  girraffes...really  not  much  of  anything.    :(
__label__0 s  mom  can't  find  a  cheap  orange  jansport  backpack  online  because  *propname*  used  one  in  twilight,  so  everyone's  paying  top-dollar  for  them.    hilarious.    :d
__label__0 is  having  fun  learning  the    principles  of  animation.    also,  i  drove  on  a  road  for  the  first  time  yesterday.    don't  worry;  it  was  just  a  few  blocks,  and  everyone  should  be  back  on  their  feet  in  no  time.    ;)
__label__0 just  told  *propname*  died.    there  was  a  short  pause.    "we  need  a  new  *propname*."    nice.
__label__0 s  hamster  died  last  night.  :(
__label__0 tuition  at  rhode  island  is    grand!!
__label__0 the  girl  walking  me  to  my  classes  today  asked  me  if  i  played  any  sports.    hahahaha  ha  ha  ha  ha...ahh,  that's  funny.    silly  cheerleaders.
__label__0 might  need  to  make  an  easier  "how-well-do-you-know"  quiz.    go  take  it  and  tell  me.    ;  )
__label__0 just  found  out  that  you  lose  your  sense  of  smell  when  you  sleep.    interesting.
__label__0 does  not  like  this  *propname*  chick!    at  all!
__label__0 can't  get  the  freaking  pictures  on  facebook  to  work!    i  hate  that  app!  >:(
__label__0 just  filled  out  a  survey  to  get  monthly  email  coupons  for  proplan  at  complete  petmart!    awesome!    ^^
__label__0 thinks  maybe  that  trying  to  upload  a  .  meg  photo  to  crappy  facebook  isn't  such  a  good  idea...
__label__0 s  mom  just  said,  "*propname*'s  right!"    lol!
__label__0 *propname*'s  tantrum  has  finally  come  to  a  close.    phew!    (read  my  note  for  more  details  ;)  )
__label__0 thinks  that  people  should  learn  more  about  a  foreign  country's  customs  and  be  more  polite  in  said  foreign  country!
__label__0 s  back  does  not  like  to  tan  (or  sunburn)  evenly!    my  back  is  splotchy  again,  and  this  time  i  didn't  even  use  sunscreen!    >:(
__label__0 had  only    hours  of  sleep  last  night  and  somehow  feels  fine,  but  will  have  -  hours  of  sleep  on  schooldays  and  cannot  seem  to  wake  up  in  the  morning.    what  the  crap  is  that??
__label__0 really  thinks  there's  no  way  she'll  finish  that  collage  by  tomorrow.    seriously.
__label__0 finds  it  funny  how  absolutely  kung  fu  panda  dominated  the  *propname*  last  year.    even  wall-e  didn't  stand  a  chance!    (oh,  yeah,  that's  what  *propname*  was  named  after.  ;)
__label__0 finally  found  her  tea  diffuser!    it's  tea  time,  biyotch!    ...hmm,  am  i  allowed  to  say  that?    guess  i'll  find  out  when  i'm  grounded  for  a  week...    ;)
__label__0 s  venus'  fly  trap  caught  its  first  bug:  a  little  gnat.    aww,  they  grow  up  so  fast...
__label__0 loved  the  new  family  guy  the  other  night.    watching  the  disney  scene  was  a  lot  of  fun.    on  that  note,  it's  all  animated  in  korea.    what  is  up  with  that?    can't  we  animate  our  own  shows  in  our  own  country?!
__label__0 has  a  new  cell  number:  ()  -.    save  it  now.    save  it!
__label__0 had  a  half  day  today!    yay!
__label__0 new  bones  yesterday,  new  soup  and  dog  whisperer  tonight,  and  new  simpsons  and  family  guy  sunday!    and  i've  brought  my  science  grade  up  from  an    to  a  !    woooo!
__label__0 really  needs  to  plan  out  the  next  two  days  carefully...  hmm...    �_�
__label__0 s  mom  is  playing  scrabble.    mom:  "what  the  heck  does  'rehem'  mean?    oh,  wait;  that  was  my  word."    i  think  she  needs  to  go  lay  down  like  *propname*  for  a  little  while.
__label__0 is  alive.    you  should  try  it  sometime;  it's  a  lot  of  fun.
__label__0 jumping  on  the  lyrics-for-status  bandwagon:  don't  let  apathy  police  the  populace,  we  will  march  across  those  stereotypes  that  were  marked  for  us.  the  answer's  obvious;  we  switch  the  consonants  and  change  the  "sword"  to  "words"  and  lift  continents.    //  <
__label__0 watched  the  president's  speech  yesterday.    wow,  i'm  sooo  indoctrinated!    [//sarcasm]    stupid  radical  jerks...
__label__0 tiny  fingers...can't  type...pinky  hurts...too  many  octaves...why?  why,  genetics,  why?
__label__0 thinks  people  should  either  do  something  or  shut  up  and  deal!    we  were  the  (pretty  much)  first  country  to  have  a  peaceful  transfer  of  power  between  political  parties.    let's  go  back  to  those  times,  shall  we?    if  you're  not  gonna  do  anything  about  what  you  don't  like,  then  please,  shut  up  and  leave  everyone  else  alone.  kthxbi.
__label__0 s  weird  cat  came  inside  not  for  a  bowl  of  food,  but  for  a  bowl  of  water.    i  poured  some  water  over  near  where  he  was  outside  and  he  came  trotting  over  straight  into  my  arms!    xd
__label__0 what?    why  did  no  one  tell  me  that  zombieland  was  filmed  at  wild  adventures?!    so  those  guys  trying  to  recruit  lhs  students  for  a  "big  movie  making  fun  of  zombie  movies  filmed  near  wa  and  in  the  woods"  were  actually  legit!    omg  i  have  to  go  see  it!  also,  all  you  people  in  valdosta  fail  for  not  telling  me  about  it!  ;)
__label__0 can't  believe  how  many  restaurants  and  stores  didn't  have  their  flags  at  half-staff  today!    how  can  you  possibly  forget  what  today  is,  especially  if  the  building  right  next  to  you  has  theirs  at  half-staff?    //  <
__label__0 new  cell  number:  ()  -
__label__0 helps  the  police,  because  nice  police  are  nice  to  me!  xd
__label__0 serving  god  is  doing  good  to  man,  but  praying  is  thought  an  easier  service  and  is  therefore  more  generally  chosen.
__label__0 just  posted  her  amazon  christmas  list  on  here.    be  sure  to  read  the  notes  at  the  top!!
__label__0 "the  role  of  bruce  wayne//batman  was  originally  offered  to  *propname*,  but  he  turned  it  down."  what??!
__label__0 would  like  to  remind  everybody  that  we  live  in  a  multicultural  society  composed  of  more  than  just  christians,  that  this  country  was  not  built  off  of  christianity  (in  fact,  many  of  our  founding  fathers  were  deists,  not  christians)  and  the  only  ones  keeping  christ  out  of  christmas  are  the  people  who  insist  on  filing  lawsuits  for  not  saying  "christmas"  instead  of  spending  their  time  caring  for  others!    happy  holidays!
__label__0 just  got  back  from  camping.    i  feel  so  disgusting...
__label__0 thinks  that  maybe  if  more  real  guys  were  more  like  *propname*  from  dragon  age,  she  might  be  more  willing  to  date.    yes,  i  seriously  just  said  that.
__label__0 *propname*.  ;)
__label__0 thinks  *propname*  deserves  yet  another  apology  from  warner  brothers.    for  multiple  reasons.    how  do  you  leave  out  the  big,  climactic  battle  scene  of  a  book?    how  does  that  happen?    and  then  you  turn  around  and  add  in  an  entire  scene  that  not  only  didn't  happen,  but  also  makes  no  sense  whatsoever.
__label__0 is  watching  the  dog  whisperer  where  an  aggressive  chihuahua  rules  all  the  pit  bulls  at  a  pit  bull  rescue!
__label__0 freakin.  loves.  photoshop.    now  if  only  i  could  find  some  classes...
__label__0 doesn't  know  what  to  do  for  some  people  for  christmas!    d:
__label__0 is  frustrated...
__label__0 got  her  game  fixed!    almost  done,  now...just  a  few  more  rooms,  then  off  to  the  evil  dragon!    i  have  a  feeling  something  bad's  gonna  happen.    just  a  hunch...
__label__0 just  watched  a  documentary  on  //  conspiracy  theorists.    those  have  got  to  be  the  most  low-down,  small-minded,  egotistical,  self-centered,  uncaring,  ignorant,  heartless  monsters  i  have  ever  seen.
__label__0 ugh,  nevermind.    got  stuck  and  had  to  backtrack.    might  as  well  do  all  the  side  quests  while  i'm  at  it.    maybe  i'll  finish  by  freaking  friday...
__label__0 feels  pretty  confident  about  the  chemistry  test  tomorrow.
__label__0 wow,  da  is  tossing  out  achievements  like  crazy.    good  ones,  too.    also,  i  cannot  type  today  to  save  my  life.    i  can't  tell  you  how  many  times  i  had  to  hit  the  backspace  while  typing  this.  x-l
__label__0 "the  world  may  end  in    but  this  show  won't."  xd  lol!
__label__0 hmm,  that  wasn't  too  bad.  had  me  worried  for  a  minute.    i've  certainly  seen  worse  endings.  like  freakin'  fallen!  seriously,  what  the  crap  was  that?!  anyways,  not  bad.  ^^
__label__0 huh.  i  stand  corrected.
__label__0 why?  why  does  bioware  have  to  be  so  mean  to  me?  i  know  mass  effect    is  out!  leave  me  alone!  dx

__label__1 day  of  phone  dates  with  trappers  &  furbearer  biologists...  ooh  baby!

__label__1 as  soon  as  i  manage  to  sit  down  and  start  being  productive,  *propname*  and  *propname*  have  to  start  being  cuter  than  ever  and  that  bottle  of  red  on  the  counter  has  to  start  being  sexier  than  ever...

__label__1 avatar  makes  me  proud  to  be  a  biologist.
__label__1 "coming  up,  it's  man  vs.  wild,  followed  by  frying  human  meat  putting  on  spices  and  saving  it  with  maggots  at  :."  gotta  love  bridget.

__label__1 hey  *propname*,  don't  make  it  bad.  don't  eat  all  the  houseplants,  chew  wires,  throw  temper  tantrums,  and  break  out  of  your  cage.    all  you  need  is  love,  little  man.
__label__1 computer's  broken  :(  worrying  about  how  many  important  files  i  may  lose.  in  brighter  news,  walked  my  rabbit  around  the  neighborhood  on  a  leash  today.
__label__1 the  dreams  are  more  fun.
__label__1 road  trip  with  my  boy,  followed  by  a  play  date  with  a  crazy  half-japanese  girl  &  two  ferrets.
__label__1 the  most  beautiful  experience  we  can  have  is  the  mysterious.    it  is  the  fundamental  emotion  which  stands  at  the  cradle  of  true  art  and  true  science.    whomever  does  not  know  it  and  can  no  longer  wonder,  no  longer  marvel,  is  as  good  as  dead,  and  his  eyes  are  dimmed.  -einstein
__label__1 ravenous  black  holes,  ripples  in  the  space-time  continuum,  intersex  bass  taking  over  us  rivers,  expectations  influencing  the  wine-tasting  experience,  the  possibility  of  quantum  memory  devices...  just  some  of  my  science  daily.  truth  blows  fiction  out  of  the  water!
__label__1 last  night,  i  learned  that  my  little  boy  (*propname*)  loves  wine  as  much  as  i  do;  hence,  i  will  no  longer  be  able  to  set  my  wine  glasses  on  the  ground.
__label__1 hmm...  has  the  mystery  of  the  loud  neighborhood  farting  noise  been  solved?
__label__1 what's  up,  cheese  apple?  your  warm,  cheesy,  buttery,  and  tart  deliciouness?  that's  what  i'm  talkin  about  ;)
__label__1 has  a  naughty  bunny.
__label__1 wow.  all  i  can  say  is,  i  was  channeling  deb  as  i  watched  that  traumatic  season  finale.
__label__1 suspects  that  this  nightly  coffee  +  dexter  combo  isn't  the  best  for  her  heart.
__label__1 a  third  of  a  chicken  of  a  bobcat?    hmm..  yes,  *propname*.
__label__1 making  love  to  my  lollipop,  mantis-style.
__label__1 is  imagining  her  feet  buried  under  the  cool,  wet  sand  and  being  sucked  toward  the  ocean.
__label__1 is  just  an  earthbound  misfit  enjoying  a  starbucks  double-shot  espresso

__label__1 note  to  self:  do  not  attempt  to  drive    miles  in  a  blizzard  ever  again.
__label__1 to  the  air  mattress,  my  noisy  nighttime  lover.
__label__1 s  entire  day..  maybe  even  entire  life..  is  dependent  on  who  wins  this  dominance  interaction  between  *propname*  &  *propname*.  go  *propname*!!!  if  *propname*  throws  this  one,  i  will  surely  be  in  a  sour  mood  for  the  rest  of  the  week.
__label__0 is  home  lovin'  on  my  kids....oh,  and  my  hubby  too  ;)
__label__0 has    friends,  so  why  is  it  that  i  feel  the  need  for  one  more?
__label__0 thinks  there  is  a  conspiracy  among  the  soup  companies  to  trick  you  into  thinking  that  the  personal  size  containers  are  simply  a  single  serving  size  when  they  actually  contain  two  servings
__label__0 well,  the  fork-lift  job  is  a  no  go.    apparently,  he  wasn't  fast  enough  -  considering  he's  never  driven  a  fork-lift  before  -  and  they  don't  have  time  to  train  him...on  to  plan  b,  i  suppose

__label__0 *propname*  fell  off  the  couch  last  night  and  fractured  the  bone  just  above  her  right  elbow  so  we  spent  most  of  the  night  in  the  er  and  most  of  this  afternoon  at  the  orthopedics  office  before  bringing  her  home  in  a  pretty  purple  cast  for  christmas
__label__0 merry  christmas,  all!    any  santa  sightings?

__label__1 know  what  sucks,  when  there  is  this  one  person  who  the  first  time  you  saw  them  you  thought  they  had  absolutely  one  of  the  most  lovable  personalities  and  nicest  smiles  ever  and  you  try  to  let  them  know  that  they  mean  so  much  to  you  in  the  little  time  you  have  around  them  and  somewhat  fail  to  do  that  then  you  keep  in  touch  with  them  nearly  every  week  you're  not  around  them  for  a  year  and  you  see  them  only
__label__1 both  times  you  plan  to  tell  them  that  and  fail  each  time,  so  you  right  one  of  the  longest,  heartfelt  notes  about  them  to  show  them  the  next  time  you're  with  them  and  when  you  finally  find  your  grand  chance  to  see  them  and  maybe  finally  tell  them  that  they've  meant  more  to  you  than  anyone  else  you've  ever  known  you  find  out  that  they've  just  got  into  a  relationship  with  someone  else.
__label__1 saw  airforce  one  yesterday  on  otis  airforce  base.
__label__1 just  got  back  from  a  nickelback  concert.
__label__1 enjoyed  doing  thriller  on  stage  at  the  oktoberfest
__label__1 two  times  in  that  period,
__label__1 snow  day!  woohoo!  ha  this  is  my  first  status  update  in  like  three  months.  umm,  giggidy,  giggidy,  goo!
__label__1 will  be  in  sj  as  of  tonight!  he'll  be  in  town  till  saturday  morning  so  call  him  and  rescue  him  from  the  boredom  that  is  his  house.
__label__1 is  unexplainably  down  :\
__label__1 has  one  more  day  in  san  jose  before  he  disappears  back  to  the  otherness  of  sacramento.
__label__1 has  been  waking  up  obscenely  early  the  last  couple  of  days;  is  anyone  up  for  breakfast  now  that  i've  been  awake  and  hour  and  a  half?
__label__1 is  finally  home  :)
__label__1 is  further  failing  at  life.  why  do  they  give  me  extra  bureaucratic  hoops  when  i  keep  proving  that  i  fail  at  jumping  through  them  ><
__label__1 would  like  the  world  to  know  that  this  next  week  he  intends  to  be  awesome  and  fix  all  of  his  problems.
__label__1 loves  beautiful  music  of  every  shape  and  size
__label__1 is  home  and  catching  up  on  facebook  :)
__label__1 is  leaving  for  anaheim  super  soon!
__label__1 had  a  fantabulous  week  and  would  like  thank  all  his  sj  friends  for  making  that  happen.  it  was  great  to  see  all  of  you.  :d
__label__1 is  hoping  his  sunday  will  turn  out  as  well  as  his  saturday  did.
__label__1 is  off  to  run  some  errands
__label__1 cannot  fall  asleep  ><
__label__1 likes  that  it  really  rained  last  night  :)
__label__1 is  tired,  and  off  to  bed
__label__1 classety  class  class  class...  :\
__label__1 no  one  should  be  frozen  in  carbonite,  or  be  slowly  digested  for  a  thousand  years  in  the  bowels  of  a  sarlaac,  just  because  they  couldn't  pay  *propname*  what  they  owe  him.  if  you  agree,  post  this  as  your  status.
__label__1 a  bit  of  relaxation  and  then  an  hour  of  beethoven.
__label__1 congratulations  all-hallowians,  i  enjoyed  a  wonderful  concert!
__label__1 needs  internal  motivation.
__label__1 has  hw  for  tomorrow  and  wednesday  that  doesn't  want  to  be  done

__label__1 last  day  of  adding...  *fingers  are  crossed*
__label__1 home  after  two  rehearsals  back  to  back...  whew  time  for  some  relaxation  then  a  nice  long  sleep  :)
__label__1 english  english  english
__label__1 another  week  of  school!!!  yay.......
__label__1 autumn  cleaning  day
__label__1 thinks  it's  awesome  that  he's  sitting  in  his  room  in  a  sweater  because  he  left  the  window  open  during  the  day.
__label__1 darn  you  *propname*'s...  my  insides  are  very  unhappy  :(
__label__1 laundry  almost  done...  it  was  a  lovely  day  for  a  walk
__label__1 yay...  beethoven  is  over!
__label__1 hates  it  when  people  are  dishonest.  :\
__label__1 sleep.
__label__1 sunday  wasn't  quite  as  awesome,  but  it  was  still  a  good  day  :p
__label__1 hates  that  he  gets  home  from  choir  at  :  or  :  and  glee  doesn't  go  up  online  till  about    am  ><
__label__1 need  some  time  with  my  brain...  time  for  a  walk
__label__1 question...  does  anyone  actually  use  the  poke  feature  on  facebook  anymore?
__label__1 thinks  that  chrome  has  come  a  long  way  since  the  first  time  he  tried  it,  and  has  gotten  fed  up  enough  with  firefox  that  he's  willing  to  give  it  another  shot.
__label__1 has    invites  to  google  wave...  i'd  love  to  try  it  out  with  anyone  that  has  a  shared  class  with  me.  let  me  know  if  you  want  in!
__label__1 would  like  to  thank  everyone  for  the  wonderful  birthday  wishes...  it's  quite  pleasant  to  be  harrassed  by  facebook    day  a  year  ;)
__label__1 blah....
__label__1 *propname*  just  started  working  on  his  first  mozart  aria...  a  bit  late  but  it'll  have  to  do  :)
__label__1 is  officially  a  bit  of  a  stupid-head...  had  this  crazy  notion  that  my  idiocy  might  not  screw  me  over  for  certain  but  oh  well.
__label__1 and  every  time  i've  held  a  rose,  it  seems  i  only  felt  the  thorns
__label__1 wowza  running  tomorrow  morning  supa  early
__label__1 must  work,  but  the  facebook  demands  my  time!
__label__1 transparent
__label__1 thinks  that  it  is  impossible  to  be  too  heavenly  minded.  watch.  those  who  are  "too  heavenly  minded"  will  do  the  greatest  good  here.
__label__1 a  prospering  tree  does  not  eat  it's  own  fruit.  a  prospering  tree  produces  fruit  that  others  might  eat.
__label__1 "knowledge  without  repentance  will  be  but  a  torch  to  light  your  way  to  hell"
__label__1 hallelujah!  hallelujah!  holy!  holy!  are  you  lord  god  almighty!  worthy  is  the  lamb,  worthy  is  the  lamb  that  was  slain!  unto  you  be  all  glory  and  honor  and  praise!  may  my  life  bring  glory  to  your  name  :)
__label__1 is  praying  hard  to  be  just  one  who  scatters  seed  on  the  earth.
__label__1 wonders  at  the  absolute  absurdity  of  man's  hatred...christ  summed  up  all  the  goodness  we  are  capable  of  in  two  commands...none  of  us  even  follows  just  one  of  them.
__label__1 says  happy  fathers  day!  in  honor  of  my  heavenly  father,  who's  never  forsaken  me  or  let  me  down.  may  you  ever  be  praised,  dad  :)
__label__1 is  going  completely  insane  with  anticipation  :)  t-minus    hours  til  *propname*'s  arrival  in  nashville!
__label__1 god  is  faithful  to  his  word  and  to  those  to  whom  he  has  given  it
__label__1 an  awakening?  lord  awaken  the  sleeper.  let  our  eyes  burst  open  to  the  rising  light  of  your  spirit.  let  your  mercy  wash  us  and  let  your  holiness  mold  us  into  the  image  of  your  son.  break  us  with  fire  and  build  us  from  the  ashes.  come  to  life  you  dry,  old  b
__label__1 an  awakening?  lord  awaken  the  sleeper.  let  our  eyes  burst  open  to  the  rising  light  of  your  spirit.  let  your  mercy  wash  us  and  let  your  holiness  mold  us  into  the  image  of  your  son.  break  us  with  fire  and  build  us  from  the  ashes.  come  to  life  you  dry,  old  b
__label__1 whatever  good  i  do  comes  not  from  me.  goodness  is  of  god,  and  through  me  he  chooses  to  make  his  power  known.  thank  you,  lord.
__label__1 is  being  conformed  to  the  image  of  christ.  do  you  want  to  be  like  jesus?  then  you  must  learn  something...you  must  learn  how  to  love  someone  who  does  not  meet  the  conditions.  it's  not  easy,  but  it's  not  impossible.
__label__1 lord  let  your  glory  fall  as  on  that  ancient  day.  let  it  fall  on  both  of  them.  let  your  grace  be  made  known  eternally  and  mightily.
__label__1 when  paul  says  "i  can  do  all  things  through  christ  who  strengthens  me"...i  think,  "i  can  do  nothing  without  you,  dear  jesus,  who  strengthens  me"
__label__1 hungers  and  thirsts  for  righteousness.
__label__1 truly  knows  so  little.  thank  you,  oh  lord,  that  you  are  wise  and  you  are  mighty.  thank  you,  lord,  that  your  grace  knows  no  limits  or  bounds.  i  pray  you're  will  be  done  here  on  earth  as  it  is  in  heaven  and  that  we  give  you  glory  with  our  lives.
__label__1 is.  learning  to  be  at  peace  and  just  be  is  harder  than  it  should  be  ;).  lord  you  are.  you  just  are.  teach  me  to  be  like  you.  teach  me  to  be.
__label__1 will  gladly  boast  in  his  weaknesses.  when  i  am  weak,  then  he  is  strong.  your  might,  oh  lord  is  endless.  please  cover  over  me.  please  cover  over  your  beloved..lest  we    all  fall  in  overwhelming  shame  under  the  weight  of  our  imperfections.
__label__1 let  me  be  one  who  leans  on  his  staff  in  the  last  days...broken  and  weak,  and  in  that  weakness  let  me  lift  my  hands  in  honor  and  praise  to  he  who  saved  me  by  his  own  merit.  thank  you  dear  father  who  makes  his  goodness  known  in  me.  may  you  be  glorified.
__label__1 is  a  tax  collector  who  standing  afar  off  would  not  even  raise  his  eyes  to  heaven.  i  pray,  "god,  be  merciful  to  me,  a  sinner."
__label__1 stop  regarding  men.  what  account  is  he?  --isaiah  :..  we  are  nothing  more  than  a  nose-full  of  breath.  oh  man,  how  frail  are  you?  why  do  you  expect  regard?  why  do  i?
__label__1 is  a  deer  panting  for  your  living  water.  i  thirst  for  the  living  god  and  in  my  thirst  i  need  your  rest.  precious  lord,  carry  me  for  even  at  my  strongest  i  lack  the  strength  to  stand  on  my  own.  amen
__label__1 gimme  your  eyes  for  just  one  second.  gimme  your  eyes  so  i  can  see.  everything  that  i  keep  missin,  gimme  your  love  for  humanity.  gimme  your  arms  for  the  broken-hearted,  the  ones  that  are  far  beyond  my  reach...
__label__1 jesus.  you're  the  lover  of  my  soul.  jesus.  i  will  never  let  you  go.  you've  taken  me  from  the  mirey  place;  set  my  feet  upon  the  rock,  and  now  i  know...
__label__1 is  excited  her  :d  for  serious,  that's  all  i  can  think  about
__label__1 because  you,  oh  lord,  are  he  who  created  all  things,  sustains  all  things,  and  knows  all  things.  all  things  came  from  you,  are  of  you,  and  will  return  unto  your  breast  from  whence  they  came.  blessing  and  honor  and  glory  to  you,  oh  father.  this  is  the  song  of  my  spirit...praising  its  origin.  you.  my  god.
__label__1 is  excited  to  see  her  :d  for  serious,  that's  all  i  can  think  about
__label__1 lord,  be  my  portion.  christ  trusted  you  to  provide  all  the  help  he  ever  needed.  let  me  do  the  same.
__label__1 loves  being  broken.  it  means  i  fought  hard  and  didn't  give  up.  i'll  wrestle  with  you,  oh  god  of  jacob,  and  i  won't  let  go.
__label__1 thinks  its  a  kind  of  non-funny  cosmic  joke  that  if  he  really  ever  does  defeat  pride...he  will  find  himself  proud  of  his  humility.  :p  good  call  *propname*
__label__1 let  me  know  you  more  deeply  and  truely,  oh  lord.  there  are  none  who  know  you  completely,  and  so  i  pray  that  you  show  me.  your  ways  are  perfect  and  i  want  my  life  to  sing  your  praise.  let  me  walk  with  love,  joy,  peace,  patience,  kindness,  goodness,  gentleness,  and  self-control.  against  such  things  there  is  no  law.
__label__1 dude,  i'm  freaking  engaged!  to  the  sweetest  angel  of  a  fiance  ever!  thank  you  lord  for  your  love  through  this  woman  :d
__label__1 i  love  *propname*  :)
__label__1 is  anxiously  attached.  i  don't  know  how  to  ask  for  help.  and  i  don't  know  how  to  accept  it.  ---i'll  drag  my  own  intestines  back  to  dyer,  thank  you  very  much.
__label__1 "hope  in  a  wasteland  of  faith;  stone  figures  hewn  down;  blood  flowing  through  ancient  sewers"
__label__1 i  can't  remember  when  the  earth  turned  slowly...so  i'll  just  wait  here  with  the  lights  turned  out  again.  i  lost  my  place,  but  i  can't  stop  this  story.  i'll  find  my  way,  but  til  then  i'm  only...spinning
__label__1 lord  please  bless  our  time  together.  its  so  difficult  to  go  so  long  without  being  with  the  treasure  you  have  graced  my  life  with.  i  pray  that  you  bring  her  to  me  safely  and  that  i  pursue  her  well.
__label__1 this  will  probably  take  a  good  long  while  to  get  used  to  :)  i  think  i'm  still  in  shock.  haha.  i  have  a  fiance.  wow.  and  not  just  any  fiance;  i  am  pursuing  the  pearl  of  great  value  :d
__label__1 everlasting,  eternal  one,  zealous  conqueror,  creator,  sustainer,  almighty...how  can  i  appeal  to  your  highest  pleasure.  what  can  i  bring  to  you  that  you  do  not  already  have?  vanity.  even  to  define  my  mission  as  one  to  bring  you  glory  is  utter  foolishness.  what  can  i  lift  up  with  these  dirty  hands?  what  can  i  sing  with  defiled  lips?
__label__1 is  waiting  on  the  lord  this  morning
__label__1 to  understand  how  ridiculously  excited  i  am  to  see  my  fiance,  you  must  first  win  the  lottery,  do  somersaults,  run  a  hundred  miles  effortlessly,  wake  up  to  birds  chirping,  eat  a  super-yummy  meal,  and  be  addicted  to  oxygen...then  you  might  get  close  to  scratching  the  surface.  maybe
__label__1 is  examining  himself.    cor  :.  testing  himself  to  see  if  he  is  in  the  faith.  work  out  your  salvation  with  fear  and  trembling  for  it  is  god  who  works  in  you  to  will  and  to  act  according  to  his  good  purpose.  phillipians  :-
__label__1 we're  goin  down  down  in  an  earlier  round...a  loaded  god  complex  is  pointed  right  at  us.  lord,  please  be  god  here.  please  bless  our  hearts  of  love
__label__1 bring  on  this  semester  :)  what  fun  things  will  i  learn??  only  god  knows  :)  ..someone's  always  missing  from  this  campus  though..  last  term  without  her...sigh*
__label__1 is  with  his  darling...oh  what  simple  things  many  take  for  granted.  thank  you  lord  for  your  gift  of  life.  thank  you  lord  for  *propname*  :)
__label__1 "i  know  what  lies  beyond  this  life  for  me  is  already  won.  no  one  can  take  away  the  blood  that  covers  over  my  bones.  without  the  blood  of  perfect  life  i  know  i'm  nothing  at  all."
__label__1 is  not  with  his  darling  anymore  :(  sad  day(s)...lord,  be  my  sustanence  as  you  always  are.  especially  now  that  much  of  my  joy  is    miles  away  from  me.  i  love  you  *propname*,  and  i  miss  you!
__label__1 "we  are  the  sons  of  holy  wrath,a  shining  light  in  the  darkthe  ones  who  walk  amongst  despair,no  sign  of  fear  in  our  hearts"
__label__1 am  on  a  saturday  is  far  to  early  to  drag  one's  self  out  of  bed...ugh,  god  thank  you  for  this  morning..even  though  i'd  like  to  be  sleeping  it  away...it  really  is  a  beautiful  morning  :)
__label__1 what  makes  people  happy?  apparently  we  really  suck  at  knowing  what  makes  us  happy.  its  a  measurable,  replicable  scientific  fact.  i  dunno  why  that  strikes  me  funny.  lol.  lord,  teach  us  to  be  joyful  in  you.
__label__1 i  don't  know  how  it  all  works.  i  don't  know  why.  i  don't  know  how.  i  just  am  who  you  made  me.  i  have  what  you  gave  me.  let  me  be  yours.  please  take  all  i  have  as  yours.  let  me  be  holy  and  of  you.  i  desire  for  my  life  to  boil  your  vapor  from  my  skin  forever.  burn  everlasting  flame.  flinted  face,  calloused  knuckles,  and  grinding  teeth...my  best.  that's  what  you  got.
__label__1 "i  believe  the  world  is  burning  to  the  ground.  oh  well,  i  guess  we're  gonna  find  out"--how  far  have  we  come,  lord?  let  us  make  the  most  of  the  time  we  do  have  here.  we  waste  too  much  time  on  so  many  things  that  don't  matter.  its  not  worth  it.  really.
__label__1 life  never  seems  to  stop  changing.  its  crazy  to  think  college  is  almost  over.  wow.  lord,  please  guide  the  steps  of  my  life  as  it  is  so  formless  yet  traced  before  me.
__label__1 dude,  its  freaking  snowing!!!!!  yay!!!!  let's  play  in  it!
__label__1 "i  gotta  feelin.  woohoo...that  tonight's  gonna  be  a  good  night"  :)  i  like  it  when  prayer's  answered  sweetly  and  things  work  out  well.  thanks  god  :)
__label__1 so  much  to  say.  so  much  to  do.  so  much  to  be.  so  little  time.    hours  is  already  to  small  an  amount  of  time.  its  hard  to  be  without  you.
__label__1 does  it  really  take  cancer  or  death  to  bring  us  to  have  a  heart  for  our  family?  really?  lord,  at  this  rate,  it'll  take  you  coming  on  the  clouds,  blowing  our  minds  and  shaking  us  from  our  complacent  lives...complacent  in  the  daily  grind.  complacent  in  our  justifiable  self-pity.  complacent  in  our  self-centeredness.  it'll  take  you  to  show  us  how  wrong  we  all  are.
__label__1 has  walked  a  thousand  miles  with  grace  so  far.  i  could  walk  like  this  forever...jesus  how  can  you  be  so  good  to  me??  may  you  be  praised  in  every  step  i  take.  always
__label__1 "i  believe  it  all  is  coming  to  an  end.  oh  well,  i  guess  we're  gonna  pretend".  ever  feel  like  a  five-year-old  who  is  content  to  cover  his//her  eyes  to  feel  safe  and  secure?  if  i  can't  see  you,  you  can't  see  me..lol..i  want  us  all  to  stop  ignoring  the  important  things.  they  won't  go  away  if  you  ignore  them.  i  promise.
__label__1 neoplatonic  thinking  postulates  "the  one"  is  infinite  and  gives  rise,  eventually,  to  this  world  of  'becoming".  lord  you  were,  are,  and  forever  will  be.  my  one.  may  i  draw  all  life  and  thought  from  your  essential  creativity.  may  i  be  made  to  be  like  your  form.  good.
__label__1 i  like  where  we  are.  here  :)...except...where's  my  julie??????  :(((.  i  don't  like  where  we  are  anymore...
__label__1 "no  demanding  without  understanding"  --*propname*
__label__1 "ever  since  the  day  i  was  born  i've  been  deciding  the  end..."  let  your  light  guide  my  way,  oh  lord.  you  are  the  great  shepherd.
__label__1 as  long  as  i'm  alive,  i'd  die  for  you.  thank  you  lord  for  your  love  and  your  awakening  it  within  me.
__label__1 "all  these  weirdos,  and  me  getting  a  little  better  every  day...i  had  never  known...that  there  might  be  a  place  for  people  like  us"--*propname*
__label__1 "wilt  thou  change  this  world...  or  wilt  thou  change  thyself?"...can't  i  do  both?
__label__1 *propname*.  the  spice  of  life.  apparently  its  one  of  my  signature  strengths  :).  how  can  i  help  make  your  life  more  adventurous  today?  thank  you,  lord,  for  making  me  salt  and  light.
__label__1 screw  you  axle
__label__1 "why  art  thou  cast  down  oh  my  soul?"  oh  yeah,  because  my  darling  isn't  here.  lord,  this  is  a  high  calling  indeed.
__label__1 thank  you,  lord,  for  today  :)  the  day  that  three    years  ago  you  let  me  start  to  make  mine  the  most  amazing  woman  ever!  :)  i  love  you  *propname*  :)
__label__1 happy  valentine's  day  everybody!  and  especially      to  my  sweet  fiancee  (with  two  "e's"),  *propname*  ,  who  makes  this  day  very  very    special    for  me!  hey  ya'll  don't  take  for  granted  that  you  can  hold  the    one  you    love  in  your  arms.  i'd  give  both  of  my  arms  just  to  see  my  love    right    now.
__label__1 though  the  air  is  cold  outside,  i  pray  you  warm  our  hearts  with  your  love.

__label__1 breaking  news:  at  the  atlanta  zoo,  an  old  guy  with  a  long  white  beard  was  caught  try  to  lure    of  each  animal  out  of  the  exhibits.    it  is  also  reported  that  he  arrived  in  a  large  wooden  boat...
__label__1 i  am  glad  to  say  that  my  parents  arrived  in  michigan  safely...even  if  thier  bags  are  lost...
__label__1 what  do  *propname*  and  the  miami  dolphins  have  in  common?  they  make  ,  people  stand  up  and  yell  "jesus  christ"...
__label__1 what  is  this  world  coming  to  when  a  complete  ahole  douchebag  like  *propname*  is  making  an  apolgy  tour,  but  still  as  not  called  the  girl  to  personally  say  i  am  sorry?    this  is  the  role  models  for  kids?    in  a  realted  note,  we  will  be  out  of  the  recession  when  the  americans  who  want  to  work  can,  not  one  moment  before...i  am  feeling  feisty  today...
__label__1 one  of  my  prospective  students  just  asked  me  out...is  it    yet?    this  week  has  been  crazy...
__label__1 *propname*  is  terrified  of  the  half  deflated  mylar  balloon  outside  of  our  condo,  when  we  went  for  a  walk  she  barked  at  it  and  then  peed  all  over  herself  when  i  grabbed  it  to  toss  it  out.    she  is  such  a  frady  pup!
__label__1 the  guy  next  to  me  getting  a  mani//pedi  tonight  reminded  me  of  someone  my  dad  would  golf  with...kinda  reminded  me  of  home  until  he  started  singing  along  with  the  radio  to  ace  of  base,  madonna,  and  cher.    it  was  so  hard  not  to  laugh!!  so  atlanta!
__label__1 i  did  not  realize  that  *propname*  (the  guy  from  "to  catch  a  predator")  went  to  msu,  that  is  actually  pretty  cool.    he  is  a  bad  ass  in  a  turtleneck!
__label__1 almost  the  weekend...only  a  few  more  short  hours...i  think  we  can  make  it.
__label__1 what  in  god's  name  happened  to  cnn.com?
__label__1 i  fell  on  the  way  to  my  car  this  morning...i  hope  that  is  not  the  predictor  of  a  bad  day!
__label__1 dang...is  this  what  people  feel  like  when  the  wings  take  it  all??    personally  when  the  wings  take  it  all  in  the  cup  it  makes  me  smile,  but  for  some  reason  a  suprizing  number  of  people  are  not  red  wings  fans...
__label__1 *propname*  cant  wait  to  dress  up  and  go  trick  or  treating!
__label__1 i  think  quite  possibly  that  msu  is  one  of  the  only  teams  in  the  big  ten  where  the  other  team  can  have  that  many  penalties  and  we  still  lose...the  pizza  pizza  bowl  is  a  goal  now...and  hockey  is  sucking  a  big  one...when  does  basketball  start?
__label__1 hey  atlanta:  you  may  see  my  work  on  the  evening  news...some  guy  was  shot  in  the  foot  in  our  parking  lot,  that  we  share  with  the  probation  office...i  have  heard  rumors  he  shot  himself...
__label__1 if  you  push  print  once....you  only  get  one  copy,  so  dont  look  at  me  like  a  moron  when  i  bring  you  the    other  copys  from  the    other  times  you  pressed  print...
__label__1 i  think  that  *propname*  was  embarassed  that  we  were  blasting  the  glee  soundtrack  while  crusing  around  with  the  top  down...i  can't  imagine  why
__label__1 my  mom  and  i  were  talking  about  all  the  food  that  reminds  me  of  home  last  night,  now  i  am  a  little  home  sick.    i  love  this  time  of  year  in  michigan!
__label__1 i  think  i  am  going  to  start  a  book  club  with  my  girlfriends...any  of  you  peaches  intersted.    in  my  mind  it  will  be  a  good  excuse  to  sit  around  and  drink  wine  and  maybe  talk  about  the  book  for  a  few  minutes...
__label__1 i  just  keep  reminding  myself...one  week  until  my  vacation,  one  week  until  my  vacation....
__label__1 no  no  no  *propname*  cannot  have  a  crush  on  shoe...
__label__1 how  did  a  hobbit  get  on  flash  forward?  that  show  is  so  crazy...
__label__1 i  cannot  believe  that  i  am  celibrating  going  to  the  pizza  pizza  bowl...
__label__1 as  much  as  i  love  twlight  (team  taylor!),  it  is  just  me,  or  is  it  extreeme  to  be  taking  kids  to  see  it  tonight  that  are  still  in  elementary  school  when  they  have  school  tomorrow!  i  guess  taking  kids  period,  with  the  attacks  and  sexual  stuff....
__label__1 my  mouth  always  gets  me  in  trouble...
__label__1 hopefully  this  week  will  not  kick  my  butt...i  don't  think  i  can  take  it  again
__label__1 wow...i  should  have  watched  more  baseball  this  year...the  twins  are  playing  really  well...crap...
__label__1 so  glee  was  not  so  bad...here  is  the  question,  is  the  diva  going  to  tell  the  ladies  and  that  is  how  *propname*  is  going  to  find  out  that  *propname*  is  the  father
__label__1 rest  in  peace  uga  the  bulldog,  the  world  of  college  mascots  morns  you  today
__label__1 maybe  it  was  a  seisure?    she  seems  ok  today,  no  weird  movements,  eating  and  drinking,  and  her  cagemate  is  acting  normal...i  read  online  that  strokes  are  common  but  it  doesnt  sound  like  they  bounce  back  that  quick...
__label__1 since  when  did  you  become  the  center  of  the  universe?
__label__1 i  am  dreading  glee  this  week...
__label__1 under  the  cover  of  shameful  darkness,  my  now  former  sister  became  a  fan  of  michigan  football.    because  you  did  not  go  there,  or  any  of  our  family  for  that  matter...that  makes  you,  my  former  sibling,  a  walmart  wolverine...yes  i  went  there!    we  will  see  where  your  loyalties  lie  when  you  need  a  kidney  or  a  piece  of  my  liver...go  nittany  lions!!
__label__1 this  rain  has  gotten  me  down  today,  that  and  the  fact  that  my  flat  iron  died...bad  hair  and  i  am  cranky...at  least  i  can  look  forward  to  glee  tonight!
__label__1 well,  i  didnt  see  that  coming...
__label__1 putting  together  my  coverletter  and  resume...i  think  i  can  i  think  i  can  i  think  i  can
__label__1 what  doesnt  kill  me  will  make  me  stronger...
__label__1 day  looking  up,  i  will  be  able  to  exchange  the  defective  flat  iron!    i  realized  that  new  moon  comes  out  when  i  will  be  home  for  thanksgiving,  any  body  want  to  go  see  it  with  me?    still  looking  forward  to  glee...i  feel  a  little  dirty  thinking  that  *propname*  is  hot
__label__1 when  doing  your  christmas  cards,  take  one  or  more  and  send  it  to  this  address:  a  recovering  american  soldier  c//o  *propname*  army  medical  center    georgia  avenue  nw;  washington,  d.c.  .  if  we  pass  this  on,  think  of  how  many  cards  these  wonderful  special  people  would  get.  pass  this  on  to  all  your  friends.  (just  copy  and  paste  to  your  wall)
__label__1 is  metal  block  the  begining  of  a  mini  breakdown?    i  feel  something  coming  on...everything  is  starting  to  back  up  on  me...
__label__1 now  i  kinda  wish  it  was  snowing...just  for  over  night,  then  after  i  am  able  to  enjoy  it  over  a  cup  of  coffee  then  it  can  vanish!
__label__1 i  hate  to  say  this,  but  *propname*  tonight  is  actually  pretty  good...having  a  hard  time  chosing  between  that  and  *propname*  lately...
__label__1 so,  my  tickets  for  saturday's  spartan  wallop  of  the  *propname*  are  in  the  mail,  i  should  have  them  tomorrow...does  anyone  want  to  go  see  u?
__label__1 let  go  spartans  lets  go!
__label__1 time  mag  named  this  decade  the  worst  since  wwii.    my  only  thought  is,  has  there  really  been  enough  decades  since  wwii  to  be  able  to  clearly  desern  that  this  one  is  the  worst?    granted  these  last  ten  years  have  really  kinda  sucked  as  far  national  tragity...but  is  there  a  need  to  call  it  the  worst  since  wwii?
__label__1 today  did  suck...*propname*  came  home  with    mega  rolls  of  one  ply  toilet  paper....i  am  going  to  be  using  prison  tp  until  at  least  easter!
__label__1 wow  i  am  really  in  a  funk...i  had  no  idea  *propname*  was  fired!  i  knew  it  was  most  likely  going  to  be  his  last  season,  but  i  hardly  ever  miss  stuff  like  that
__label__1 why  are  people  from  new  jersey  so  proud  of  being  from  new  jersey?
__label__1 i  was  just  watching  "*propname*  in  real  life"  while  i  was  working  on  my  christmas  cards,  and  i  just  realized...*propname*  (*propname*)    is  the  cop  that  pulls  *propname*  over  and  has  his  cruiser  backed  into.    he  is  way  better  looking  without  that  hair!
__label__1 so,  i  got  something  in  my  eye  and  rubbed  it  and  now  it  looks  like  i  got  punched  in  the  face...everyone  was  making  domestic  violence  jokes  at  the  party...
__label__1 does  this  have  to  happen  tonight...i  have  my  fight  club
__label__1 i  am  in  a  funk  today...i  dont  know  if  it  is  depression,  maybe  a  lack  of  motivation  because  of  depression.    this  process  is  not  for  the  impatient.
__label__1 thank  god  for  facebook  or  everyone  would  have  names  misspelled  on  thier  cards...
__label__1 my  thanksgiving  utopia  lasted  a  whole  hour...new  record.
__label__1 it  was  good  to  get  out  of  the  house  for  a  little  while,  and  even  better  to  see  my  girls!
__label__1 apple  casserole  and  herb  pork  loin  smells  so  good!!

__label__1 first  day  of  winter  is  not  so  bad  in  atlanta...
__label__1 dear  baby  jesus:  please  compell  my  boyfriend  to  get  off  his  ass  and  pack...we  are  leaving  tomorrow  at    am  to  go  home  and  celibrate  your  birth...and  i  really  dont  want  to  have  to  kill  him  because  then  i  will  have  to  drive  the  mustang  in  the  snow  and  rosie  is  in  mint  condition  and  the  salt  will  discolor  my  top.    thanks  so  much...
__label__1 "over  the  river  and  to  the  woods  to  boosha's  house  we  go!"
__label__1 baking  pumpkin  bread  and  pumkin  pies  and  making  stuffing!!
__label__1 so...i  never  got  the  facination  with  farmville  until  i  built  my  zoo...totally  addicted!    if  you  have  zooworld  let  me  know  i  will  send  you  a  gift
__label__1 so  the  guito  from  jersey  shore  that  calls  him  self  "the  situtation"  is  trying  to  trademerk  it  now...
__label__1 what  is  going  on  with  this  bowl  game?    i  thought  that  msu  losing  %  of  thier  players  was  bad...now  texas  tech  coach  scandle?      if  you  were  going  to  toss  a  kid  in  the  closet...would  you  chose  the  one  whose  dad  is  on  tv  everynight??    bad  call  dude!

__label__1 oye,  so  tired...sometimes  i  wish  that  we  could  spend  more  time  enjoying  and  less  time  preparing  this  time  of  year
__label__1 i  am  so  so  excited...going  to  the  big  game...heading  home...going  to  see  my  dog...i  cant  sleep!
__label__1 maybe  going  home  grounded  me...i  feel  so  much  better  now!
__label__1 feeling  much  better  today!    so  if  the  head  coach  of  texas  tech  was  fired,  is  this  even  going  to  be  a  fair  game?    maybe  considering  many  of  our  players  were  stupid...
__label__1 feels  like  death  warmed  over...
__label__1 snow  predicted  when  i  go  home!!    i  cant  wait!
__label__1 getting  ready  to  come  home  for  christmas!

__label__1 good  job  ballers...its  all  up  to  the  football  team  now!    go  green,  go  white,  go  state!
__label__1 oh  no  *propname*  is  really  sick,  i  even  made  him  chicken  soup  yesterday,  and  he  still  is  running  a  fever!
__label__1 well,  big  ten  is  looking  awsome  in  the  bowls  so  far,  the  buck  and  the  kittens  gave  great  show...hopefully  msu  will  follow  suit!
__label__1 *propname*  is  flying  into  chicago  tonight...i  will  miss  that  guy!
__label__1 now  *propname*  is  sick...and  realizes  what  a  jerk  he  was  when  i  was  sick
__label__1 and  the  grinch,  with  his  grinch-feet  ice  cold  in  the  snow,  stood  puzzling  and  puzzling,  how  could  it  be  so?  it  came  without  ribbons.  it  came  without  tags.  it  came  without  packages,  boxes  or  bags.  and  he  puzzled  and  puzzled  �till  his  puzzler  was  sore.  then  the  grinch  thought  of  something  he  hadn�t  before.  what  if  christmas,  he  thought,  doesn�t  come  from  a  store.  what  if  christmas,  perhaps,  means  a  little  bit  more.
__label__1 had  a  great  game  night  with  the  family...we  should  do  that  more  often  when  i  am  home...next  time  with  drinks!
__label__1 going  to  have  my  emmissions  tested,  want  to  just  get  that  out  of  the  way  and  today  seems  like  a  good  day  for  it!    also  running  other  errands...

__label__1 the  devistation  in  haiti  is  heartbreaking,  i  cannot  imagine  when  they  start  running  out  of  food  and  water,  and  without  a  sewer  system  that  is  going  to  be  hell  in  that  climate...i  really  hope  there  is  not  violence  when  resources  are  exahusted

__label__1 has  anyone  else  noticed  that  the  dolphin  with  the  helmet  on  the  miami  dolphins  logo  looks  like  it  should  be  riding  the  short  bus?
__label__1 so  variety  is  reporting  that  the  cast  of  jersey  shore  is  coming  back  for  a  second  season,  making  $,  per  episode.    i  guess  they  were  making  a  few  hundred  per  episode  before.    that  is  alot  of  tanning,  hair  products,  and  tiny  tops!
__label__1 i  really  really  hope  people  dont  start  using  "post-it"  as  a  reason  for  loyality.    greys  is  getting  stupid...
__label__1 i  reunited  a  cat  with  her  owner  today...feels  nice  but  i  am  not  sure  how  to  tell  denny  there  was  a  cat  in  the  condo....
__label__1 dishwasher  repair  guy  coming  tomorrow  am,  hopefully  phone  that  works  being  delivered  tomorrow  as  well.    big  day  ahead!

__label__1 it  makes  me  sad  to  see  *propname*  all  iced  over...
__label__1 my  phone  stopped  working,  i  can  call  out,  but  the  person  i  call  cannot  hear  me!
__label__1 the  "full  house"  home  is  on  the  market  for    mil.    i  wonder  if  being  fetured  in  the  show  increased  its  value
__label__1 getting  ready  to  watch  the  game
__label__1 my  facebook  looks  the  same...am  i  missing  something?
__label__1 *propname*  mixed  week  old  coucous  with  new  coucous,  and  he  cannot  understand  why  i  will  not  eat  it...
__label__1 thank  you  to  everyone  that  was  able  to  come  out  for  my  birthday  dinner,  and  i  sincerely  appologize  to  the  guys  that  thought  that  tapas  bar  was  topless  bar...

__label__1 poor  little  wolverines...at  this  rate  the  nit  is  a  goal!!    look  at  your  sad  little  glum  faces...
__label__1 it's  doppelganger  week.  change  your  profile  picture  to  someone  famous  you  have  been  told  you  resemble  (actor,  singer,  athlete,  etc)...i  have  been  told  by  multiple  people  that  i  look  like  *propname*.    i  guess  it  could  be  worse

__label__1 offer  accepted  on  house,  woo.    currently  making  angel  food  cake  with  choc//hazelnut  frosting  for  *propname*'s  bday  picnic.  also,  we  bought  a  lizard  with  a  bad  leg  to  see  if  we  could  fix  him  any  better  than  the  pet  store.  poor  guy.
__label__1 is  now  a  home  owner.  move  in  is  saturday.    we  spent  last  night  scrubbing  the  place.
__label__1 is  preparing  for  his  first  real  vacation  in  over  a  decade  where  i  can  just  sit  there  for  a  week  on  purpose.
__label__1 atit!  (almost  there!  it's  thursday!)  reaching?  why  yes  i  am.
__label__1 took  a  long  time  to  come  up  with  a  costume,  but  has  decided  to  be  the  mad  scientist  from  half  life,    crowbar  included.
__label__1 (rap  performed  by  *propname*)  darkness  falls  across  the  land  the  midnite  hour  is  close  at  hand  creatures  crawl  in  search  of  blood  to  terrorize  y'awl's  neighborhood  and  whosoever  shall  be  found  without  the  soul  for  getting  down  must  stand  and  face  the  hounds  of  hell  (continued  below)
__label__1 is  tired  of  being  sick.  death  to  all  swine.
__label__1 (continued  from  above)  and  rot  inside  a  corpse's  shell  the  foulest  stench  is  in  the  air  the  funk  of  forty  thousand  years  and  grizzly  ghouls  from  every  tomb  are  closing  in  to  seal  your  doom  and  though  you  fight  to  stay  alive  your  body  starts  to  shiver  for  no  mere  mortal  can  resist  the  evil  of  the  thriller  (into  maniacal  laugh,  in  deep  echo)

__label__1 will  be  hosting  *propname*  for  a  seminar  in  january!    woo!
__label__1 is  preparing  for  the  move,  settlement  tuesday.
__label__1 has  made  some  downright  amazing  scallop  chowder.
__label__1 ninja  landscaping  for  the  win.
__label__1 tcif!
__label__1 it's  alive!    no  more  flu  &  at  work.
__label__1 gdim!
__label__1 thinks  whoever  decided  to  schedule  a  massive  apartment  building  fire  next  door  to  our  new  home  at  this  time  of  day(isham)  was  terribly  inconsiderate,  no  fires  until  at  least  breakfast.    off  to  hose  the  outside  of  the  house  after  being  up  until  am  mortaring  the  downstairs.
__label__1 has  the  flu.    i  was  so  uninclined  to  move  that  i  actually  watched  a  football  game.  i  made  due  by  pondering  the  mechanics  of  impact,  timing  and  footwork  in  play  by  play  cases.  also  created  an  under    yard  endzone  score  for  which  there  is  no  defense,  i  call  it  the  the  crane  technique.
__label__1 osit!
__label__1 now  has  lens  flare,  thanks  *propname*.
__label__1 needs  to  get  a  nifty  book,  a  language  version  and  a  development  environment  that  actually  work  together.  i've  got  this  book  on  python  for  hacking//reverse  engineering,  but  it's  for  .,  which  is  a  not  compatible  old  standard(current  is  +)  and  for  an  older  version  of  eclipse,  which  has  also  had  a  massive  change  in  the  current  version  and  this  book  was  published  in  .
__label__1 would  like  to  thank  everyone  for  the  birthday  wishes.    it  was  a  very  tame,  but  very  nice  birthday.      also,  i'd  like  to  recommend  ninja  assassin,  everything  that  is  good  about  ninja  with  excellent  choreography.
__label__1 yay  halloween  party.    i  have  my  crazy  hair,  lab  coat  &  crowbar.  that  and  my  crazy  jello  molds  and  i'm  all  set.      (pictures  later.)
__label__1 has  smashed  his  living  room  to  bits.          large  bags  of  debris  so  far.
__label__1 pre-birthday  happy  hour,  tonight,  o'sheas,  :ish  to  whenever.    i  realize  it's  late  notice,  come  if  you  can  manage.
__label__1 raid  data  recovered  completely  from  swapped  pair  that  was  unrecognized  by  nas  after  nas  flipped  out  and  wiped  itself    times.    gb  data  now  safe.
__label__1 approves  of  his  raise.
__label__1 thinks  this  is  awesome.  http:////www.alternative-energy-news.info//ultra-lightweight-bendable-batteries//
__label__1 anyone  ever  rebuild  a  raid  array  before  and  have  tips?  i've  got  two  drives  of  a  raid  +  (one  from  each  pair  i  think),  that  need  to  have  data  recovered.  trying  different  recovery  software  at  the  moment  (ufs  recovery  atm),  but  happy  to  have  any  advice.
__label__1 has  emptied  his  closets  and  clothes  box  from  the  move  and  is  completely  reorganizing  everything,  it  looks  like  a  clothes  bomb  went  off  in  his  bedroom.
__label__1 cthulhumas,  cthulhumas,  cthulhu  eats  your  brains.  oh  what  fun  it  is  to  die  in  many  horrible  ways.    cthulhumas,  cthulhumas,  cthulhu  eats  your  brains.  hey.    may  you  all  be  touched  by  his  noodly  appendage  during  these  holy  days.
__label__1 is  getting  tired  of  long  long  nights  on  salary.
__label__1 happy  new  years!
__label__1 holy  poop  on  a  stick,  that  was  a  long  day.
__label__1 octarine!
__label__1 just  saw  the  season  finale  of  dexter.    holy  shit.
__label__1 would  appreciate  if  his  intestines  would  agree  to  parley  and  come  to  an  amicable  arrangment  with  his  stomach.      they've  had  a  war  going  for  a  few  weeks  now.
__label__1 weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee  !      welcome  to  the  future!
__label__1 is  going  to  check  our  floors  for  the  living  room  today  and  then  maybe  to  a  gentlemanly  game  night.
__label__1 "how  about  a  nice  game  of  strip  global  thermonuclear  war?"
__label__1 stomach  versus  intestines,  round  .
__label__1 holy  shit,  we're  buried  in  under  lots  of  snow!    no  escape.....    argh...  the  snow..  oh  god.  a  transformer  just  exploded..
__label__1 thank  cthulhu  it's  friday!
__label__1 happy  new  years!
__label__1 watched  and  heard  "  thick  branchs  near  the  top  of  one  the  pine  trees  in  my  backyard  snapping  under  snow  weight  and  taking  branches  with  it.        i  saw  that,  said  oh  crap,  let's  go  have  a  look,  ran  out,  look  up,  realized  i  was  under  the  remainder  and  said  oh  crap,  let's  go  back  in.    it's  ragnarok!    prepare  for  the  end!
__label__0 is  not  surprised  the  states  most  utilizing  their  natural  energy  endowments  are  facing  the  smallest  budget  gaps  for  the  upcoming  fiscal  year.  california:  your  move
__label__0 wonders,  what's  the  use  of  having  a  bulwark  against  cloture  if  you  can't  exercise  party  discipline  anyway.
__label__0 is  reading  his  packet  for  law  school  orientation.  this  is  all  very  exciting  and  petrifying  at  the  same  time.
__label__0 sends  his  blessings  to  those  who  keep  the  embers  of  freedom  alight.  happy  independence  day!
__label__0 awoke  to  an  email  stating:  "starting  in  ,  the  us  department  of  education  will  be  requiring  significant  changes  in  the  way  educational  institutions  collect  and  report  race//ethnicity  data.  accordingly,  on  july  ,  ,  lsac  changed  the  race//ethnicity  d
__label__0 always  looks  on  the  bright  side  of  life:  our  supreme  court  will  now  be  two-thirds  catholic.
__label__0 is  highly  amused.  the  comparisons  between  *propname*  and  *propname*,  as  well  as  claims  of  her  narcissism,  are  a  classic  case  of  psychological  projection.  (*propname*,  really?  just  how  frightened  are  they  of  this  woman?)  the  msm  are  actually  referring  to  no
__label__0 rarely  ever  gets  sick.  hopefully  this  will  pass  quickly.
__label__0 was  happy  to  learn  it  wasn't  a  furlough  but  a  scheduling  mistake  that  created  the  lapse.  back  to  work  tomorrow.
__label__0 is  attending  the  royal  fireworks  festival  &  concert  tonight  at  riverfront  park.
__label__0 is  feelin'  much  better  (and  stronger  everyday)
__label__0 is  now  on  (the)  twitter.  this  had  better  be  worth  it.
__label__0 is  reminded  of  the  underpants  gnomes  when  listening  to  the  hhs  secretary  ignore  clear  evidence  that  socialized  medicine  won't  lower  health  care  costs.
__label__0 came  home  to  a  box  of  panda  licorice,  a  favorite.  i  feel  loved.
__label__0 "i  may  be  limping,  but  i'm  coming  home"
__label__0 is  wishing  his  kitty  a  happy  (and  momentous)  two-month  anniversary.
__label__0 ""all  that  is  necessary  for  the  triumph  of  evil  is  that  good  men  do  nothing."  -  *propname*
__label__0 wonders,  with  all  this  righteous  indignation  over  a  terrorist  assassination  program  and  change  in  tactics  from  pursuing  the  taliban  to  protecting  the  population,  when  did  this  stop  being  a  war?
__label__0 is  on  the  road  again  and  deeply  saddened  to  be  separated  from  the  kitty  for  the  rest  of  the  week.
__label__0 has  on  his  soothsayer  cap:  [one  day,  parents  who  send  their  children  to  "super-gold-plated-cadillac"  private  schools  will  pay  additional  taxes  to  cover  the  educational  expenses  of  lower  income  families]
__label__0 is  doing  a  little  catch-up  work  but  excited  to  start  school  tomorrow.
__label__0 r.i.p.  *propname*
__label__0 is  steadily  developing  an  iron  butt.  and  no,  he  hasn't  been  to  the  gym  lately.
__label__0 will  concede  health  care  is  a  moral  issue  when  the  same  proponents  acknowledge  abortion  is  immoral.
__label__0 is  pleased  the  american  people  will  now  have  the  time  to  read  the  government-run  health  care  bill  or  have  it  interpreted  for  them.  apparently,  this  is  a  luxury  our  representatives  (and  president)  couldn't  find  the  time  in  their  busy  schedules  to  accomplis
__label__0 is  one  lucky  guy.  first  class,  first  day  as  a  l  and  i'm  the  first  to  be  called  on  to  state  the  case.  thankfully,  i  did  alright.
__label__0 is  thinking,  what's  not  to  love  about  a  city  that  hosts  a  festival  called,  "pig  out  in  the  park"
__label__0 is  looking  forward  to  a  steak  dinner  tonight  in  celebration  of  four  years  together  as  a  couple.
__label__0 always  says,  whatever  doesn't  kill  you  makes  you  luckier.
__label__0 is  thankful;  only  justice  scalia's  wit  could  make  civ  pro  bearable  reading  at  this  hour.
__label__0 is  pondering  the  contradictions  in  his  fidelity  to  a  jealous  mistress.
__label__0 reminds  those  engaging  in  civil  discourse;  when  you  have  to  resort  to  accusations  of  racism,  you're  probably  losing  the  debate.
__label__0 wonders  which  is  more  inappropriate;  heckling  during  a  presidential  address  to  congress  or  the  president  himself  calling  a  private  citizen  a  "jackass".
__label__0 it's  beginning  to  look  a  lot  like  washington  around  here.
__label__0 has  settled  on  a  parish.  happy  days.
__label__0 is  in  santa  clara  to  see  the  family.  still  missing  the  kitty.
__label__0 was  greatly  disappointeed  with  the  disgustingly  partisan  scriptwriting  on  law  and  order  last  night.
__label__0 mr  hart's  l  advice:  when  preparing  for  the  socratic  method,  remember  to  think  in  questions.
__label__0 remembers  the  good  old  days  when  we  could  pay  for  everything  under  the  sun  by  "bringing  the  troops  home".  it  amazes  me  how  inconsistent  we  can  be  when  the  birkenstock  is  on  the  other  foot.
__label__0 *propname*  was  bad  enough,  but  at  least  he  distorted  data  and  concocted  fear-mongering  chartsngrafs  to  support  his  cockamamie  theory.  the  norwegian  nobel  committee  just  lost  its  credibility--forever.
__label__0 wonders  if  serfs  living  under  a  nationalized  health  care  scheme  lead  healthier  lifestyles  mostly  for  fear  of  becoming  sick//injured  and  having  to  throw  themselves  at  the  mercy  of  its  poor  services.
__label__0 doesn't  think  passing  a  bill  on  *propname*'s  casket  would  legitimize  killing  health  care  for  the  rest  of  us.
__label__0 is  thinking  of  a  movie  title;  dr.  strangehair  or:  how  i  learned  to  stop  worrying  and  love  the  cue  ball  look
__label__0 is  making  a  four-minute  oral  argument  tomorrow.  should  be  interesting.
__label__0 thinks  people  in  straw  houses  shouldn't  blow  hot  air...or  propose  a  homeowner's  insurance  public  option  for  that  matter.
__label__0 reckons  it's  looking  a  lot  like  washington  in  california  right  now.
__label__0 wasn't  disuaded  post-media  blitz.  still  thinks  taxes  are  an  appropriation  of  wealth,  mandates  are  backed  implicitly  with  a  gun  and  "freedom  from  want"  is  a  condition  better  reserved  for  animals  and  small  children.
__label__0 thinks  he  did  alright.  not  necessarily  kicking  asterisks  and  taking  case  names,  but  certainly  alright.
__label__0 you  know  that  feeling  you  get  when  you're  running  a  marathon  and  the  endorphins  finally  kick  in...
__label__0 we  have  growth,  but  at  the  price  of  future  jobs--all  the  while  paying  five  times  as  much  for  the  same  car  we  would've  bought  later.  what  else  can  be  done  to  keep  up  this  facade  of  recovery?  we're  already  printing  more  money  than  ever  before.  we  can't  raise  taxes  without  calling  it  a  fee,  because  dear  leader  wants  to  be  re-elected.  can  we  still  hit  the  brakes  before  this  public-private  hybrid  goes  into  a  ditch?
__label__0 it's  crunch  time.  see  y'all  in  a  month  or  so.
__label__0 first  law  school  midterm  this  monday.  this  one's  for  a  third  of  the  clams.
__label__0 happy  thanksgiving
__label__0 "life  is  white,  and  i  am  black.  jesus  and  his  lawyer  are  coming  back."
__label__0 is  celebrating  six  months  months  together  with  my  beautiful  bride.
__label__0 legal  research  reminds  me  of  combing  the  ocean  floor  for  treasures.  every  once  in  a  while  i  return  to  the  same  spot  with  the  knowledge  that  what  i  thought  was  a  rock  might  have  actually  been  an  oyster  with  a  pearl  inside.
__label__0 finals  begin  next  monday.  overhead  this  today  in  torts:  "dude,  you're  fine.  it's  not  crunch  time  yet."
__label__0 second  season  of  the  paper  chase  is  being  released  this  december.  sweeeet.
__label__0 finals.
__label__0 just  began  his  first  involuntary,  five-day  furlough.  so  sad.
__label__0 well,  that  was  just  about  the  longest    months  and  shortest    hours  of  my  entire  life.  same  time  next  year,  i  hope.
__label__0 is  convinced,  with  everyone  and  their  mother  talking  about  the  possibility  of  raising  taxes  on  the  middle  class,  it's  not  going  to  happen.  do  you  really  think  one  of  the  most  shrewd  politicians  since  *propname*  would  all  but  certify  the  loss  of  his  re-
__label__0 is  no  keynesian,  but  i  think  if  there's  one  thing  "cash  for  clunkers"  demonstrates,  it's  that  $  billion  (minus  the  $  billion  in  tax  cuts)  would've  been  more  stimulative  coming  from  the  pockets  of  american  consumers  than  vested  bureaucrats  in  washing
__label__0 is  in  sf  to  attend  a  two-day  prep  course  for  school.  still  separated  from  my  bride  and  hating  every  minute  of  it.
__label__0 an  obama  consultant  yesterday  on  taxing  high-value,  middle  class  health  care  plans:  "we're  not  talking  about  a  new  tax  on  these  people.  we're  saying  they  currently  get  an  enormous  tax  break  and  we're  going  to  slightly  scale  that  back  .  .  ."  this  will  likely  be  the  talking  point  for  any  new,  middle-class  taxes  to  come.
__label__0 is  going  to  law  school.  see  y'all  in  three  years.
__label__0 heard  the  pres  was  on  the  tv  tonight
__label__0 gets  to  see  philip  glass  as  a  birthday  present  for  the  second  year  in  a  row.  hmm  wot's  that  phrase  the  kids  use...ftw!
__label__0 i  thought  the  kindle  was  a  stupid  idea,  but  the  ipad...wow,  this  is  the  future  of  personal  computing,  a  segue  into  minority  report-like  "surface  computing".  way  to  stay  ahead  of  the  curve,  apple.
__label__0 along  with  wife  *propname*,  have  decided  to  celebrate  filing  their  first,  joint  tax  return  in  that  good-old-fashioned  american  way,  by  purchasing  a  new  tv.
__label__0 how  nice  of  the  nfl  to  ask  my  favorite  band  to  play  at  the  superbowl  for  my  birthday.
__label__0 loves  usps.  when  you  underpay  for  online  postage,  they  charge  you  at  the  counter.  when  you  overpay,  they  pocket  the  difference  and  say  "thank  you".  isn't  that  just  the  federal  government  in  a  nutshell?
__label__0 is  strongly  considering  jag  after  law  school.  might  attend  ocs  over  the  summer.
__label__0 thanks  for  the  birthday  wishes.  you  guys  are  awesome.
__label__0 *propname*  is  hilarious.
__label__0 is  %  of  the  way  to  my  goal  of  running  three  miles  in  eighteen  minutes.  good  first  attempt.
__label__0 wonders  why  no  one  ever  followed  up  on  *propname*'s  pledge  to  eat  the  cra.
__label__0 whoa,  an  a  in    ap  english...  well,  i'm  content  now.
__label__0 r.i.p.,  *propname*.  maybe  people  will  be  less  cruel  to  you  where  you  are  now.
__label__0 just  made  civic  jazz  orchestra!!!
__label__0 "his  cheeks  and  eyes  burned  from  the  cold."
__label__0 holy  crap,  *propname*  is  really,  really  good.
__label__0 i'm  out  from  tomorrow  'til  friday.
__label__0 rip  *propname*.  the  world  owes  you  a  great  debt  for  everything  you've  done  for  music.
__label__0 off  to  st.  louis.  back  on  friday.
__label__0 is  about  to  play  at  the  detroit  international  jazz  festival  on  the  same  stage  as  *propname*.  no  pressure,  though.
__label__0 "we  would  shout  and  swim  about//  the  coral  that  lies  beneath  the  waves.//  oh  what  joy  for  every  girl  and  boy//  knowing  they're  happy  and  they're  safe!//  we  would  be  so  happy,  you  and  me,//  no  one  there  to  tell  us  what  to  do.//  i'd  like  to  be  under  the  sea//  in  an  octopus'  garden  with  you."  -  in  memoriam  requiescat,  pater:  august  ,    -  april  ,  .

__label__0 steamroll  the  irish,  wolverines.
__label__0 as  always,  geh  blau!
__label__0 at  last!  house...
__label__0 just  visited  wash.  u.  in  st.  louis,  and  is  very  impressed.
__label__0 "did  someone  just  page  the  king  of  awesome?"
__label__0 c'mon,  michigan!
__label__0 is  off  -  again!  -  looking  at  colleges,  but  this  time,  out  east.  brown//wesleyan//yale//rochester  impressions  when  i  get  back,  if  you  want  them.
__label__0 b-but...  impossible...  the  lions  can't  win,  can  they?
__label__0 "every  year  is  getting  shorter,  never  seem  to  find  the  time...  plans  that  either  come  to  naught  or  half  a  page  of  scribbled  lines..."
__label__0 ...where  did  fall  go?
__label__0 "heaven  send  hell  away  no  one  sings  like  you  do  anymore."
__label__1 says  "sorry  orlando  but  *propname*  failed  the  heat.  he  was  always  going  to  fail  you."
__label__1 thinks  the  orlando  magic  should  change  their  name  to  the  orlando  joke.
__label__1 my  mother  saw  the  proposal  without  me  so  i've  lost  my  excuse  to  go  see  it.
__label__1 there's  nothing  less  cool  than  being  exhausted  from  hours  of  not  doing  a  damn  thing  at  all.
__label__1 hey!  have  you  heard  the  news?  *propname*  died.  no!  say  it  isn't  so,  *propname*  died.
__label__1 i'm  trying  hard  not  to  meet  you  when  i'm  sleeping.
__label__1 let's  talk  about  how  much  fun  we  had  about  fucking  the  world.
__label__1 would  you  believe  i  forgot  to  enter  the  football  lottery?
__label__1 has  a  new  medicine.  it's    movie  channels  on  a  television.
__label__1 i'll  jump  and  kick  and  bite  and  scratch  and  scream  until  i'm  blue  in  the  face.
__label__1 dyslexia  for  cure  discovered.
__label__1 will  be  at  monday  night  raw  in  orlando  tonight.  i'll  be  the  one  promoting  "straight  *propname*'s  man  slammin'  max-out."
__label__1 is  getting  saddr  &  weirdr.
__label__1 is  filling  up  boxes  and  boxes  and  soon  i'll  get  in  one  too.
__label__1 *propname*  was  pardoned  today  for  having  romantic  ties  with  a  white  woman  in  .  now...  racism  is  dead.
__label__1 is  back  to  thinking  about  nowhere.
__label__1 can't  lie.  he  misses  gainesville,  everyone  in  it  and  can't  wait  to  get  back.
__label__1 denver  tried  to  keep  me.
__label__1 net  worth:  $,.

__label__1 is  going  to  go  visit  the  homie  locked  up  in  the  joint.
__label__1 to  all  my  friends  out  there,  i  better  not  have  to  visit  any  of  you  at  a  jail  house.  looking  at  a  good  friend  through  some  glass  is  depressing.
__label__1 do  i  party  too  much  or  do  i  not  party  enough?
__label__1 chia-like,  i  shall  grow.
__label__1 there's  nothing  to  do  but  eat  ritz  crackers  and  neglect  school  work.
__label__1 has  the  only  story  that  is  open,  baby.  he  only  sells  beer  and  he  only  sells  ice  cream.
__label__1 never  trust  a  man  without  an  embarrassing  secret.

__label__0 first  there  was  tiger;  then  tigger;  and  now  lust.    the  alphabet  soup  of  federal  bureaucrats  never  ceases  to  amuse  me.    and  how  ironic  lust  stands  for  so-not-sexy  "leaking  underground  storage  tanks".
__label__0 i'm  not  quite  sure  how  i  feel  about  having  my  singing  voice  compared  to  *propname*  (especially  when  the  boyfriend  makes  the  comparison).

__label__1 just  got  a  call  for  an  interview  for  a  job  she  applied  for  back  in  june.  go  figure.  sometimes  things  take  time.  cross  your  fingers  :)
__label__1 new  york  marathon  happening  right  outside  her  window.  woooo
__label__1 is  just  not  able  to  win  on  vampire  wars..booo..at  least  she  lives  in  nyc!  yay!
__label__1 listening  like  crazy  to  the  glee  soundtrack,  happy  in  her  very  clean  room,  excited  for  new  beginnings,  grateful  for  today,  tomorrow,  and  everyday,  even  the  bad  ones  :)  a  hug  for  everyone!
__label__1 thanks  you  so  much  for  all  the  birthday  wishes!  she  had  a  really  amazing  time  :)  xoxo
__label__1 the  best  ways  to  get  rid  of  moody  mondays,  and  the  past  few  days  of  moodiness  are  to  talk  to  mom,  volunteer,  talk  to  *propname*,  watch  an  amazing  episode  of  dexter,  and  be  thankful  for  all  the  blessings  in  life  that  are  free  for  the  taking  :)
__label__1 squeals  of  little  girl  delight!  going  home  to  south  florida  tomorrow!  been  over    months  :)
__label__1 spending  her  saturday  night  home  watching  movies  with  hot  cocoa.  yum!
__label__1 has  only    more  days  left  before  she  gives  her  life  away  for  *propname*'s  market  week...sigh..lol
__label__1 has  one  extra  day  then  she  expected  and  begins  her  hardcore  assignment  sunday,  not  saturday.  one  day  of  extra  rest  never  hurt  anyone  :)
__label__1 -  smile  and  the  whole  world  smiles  with  you.  -  motivation,  not  desperation  will  get  you  what  you  want.  -  the  only  way  to  go  is  up.  -  family  is  always  there  for  you,  and  having  even  a  handful  of  reliable  friends  makes  life  even  better  :)
__label__1 clocked  in    hours  today.  smiled  at  *propname*  like  a  moron  as  she  walked  by...umm  how  was  i  to  know  what  she  looked  like?  at  least  i  know  who  she  is.  fashion  is  hard.  models  are  very  nice  though.  til  next  tuesday...
__label__1 wants  to  be  like  *propname*  and  do  a  monologue  of  all  her  thoughts  and  feelings.  if  only  the  audience  were  up  to  it.  hmmm...
__label__1 had  a  better  day  than  yesterday.  lack  of  sleep  makes  *propname*  an  unhappy  girl
__label__1 #&*(@^!)&  &*()!&*(#^!(*)@!*(  ^*!&*(
__label__1 is  walking  on  sunshine!  cold  weather,  hot  cocoa,  new  moon  coming  soon,  good  food  in  the  tummy,  and  a  brighter  outlook  on  life.  yay!  it  is  true...  those  things  do  pass,  and  sometimes  they  need  a  helping  kick  out  the  door.  :)  lol
__label__1 drum  roll  please....  hours  this  week  of  working.  :)  going  back  in  at  :,  then  it  is  over  tuesday..yay
__label__1 is  sooo  happy.  things  are  coming  together.  so  grateful  for  all  the  wondeful  people  in  life  that  make  it  so  great.  just  so  so  so  so  happy!
__label__1 had  a  great  time  in  the  snow,  seeing  "mr.  big"  with  *propname*and  *propname*,  and  is  happily  relaxing  now...but  such  a  pity  about  *propname*.  live  life  to  the  fullest  :)
__label__1 is  going  to  see  the  lovely  bones,  cause  it  is  already  out  in  nyc..yay!
__label__1 is  still  thinking  about  how  amazing  the  season  finale  of  dexter  was...wow.  and  is  now  hooked  on  lost...she  gets  it  now.  still  agonizing  over  seeing  boone  go  bye  bye...sexy  sexy  man
__label__1 needs  a  love  song  that  speaks  of  boots  that  take  your  breath  away,  or  the  sadness  inside  you  feel  when  a  beautiful  piece  of  clothing  costs  more  than  a  teeth  cleaning.  no  more  of  this  stuff  about  wishing  a  guy//girl  would  love  you.  how  about  wishing  you  had  a  place  to  wear  a  $,  gown?  could  afford  a  $,  gown?  :)
__label__1 is  sharing  the  secrets  of  the  best  products  she  has  used  lately.  the  instyler-  amazing  hair,  even  with  light  mist  outdoors.  urban  decay  primer  potion-  i  rub  my  eyes  a  lot  and  it  still  stays  (wish  it  worked  for  mascara).  forever  makeup  aqua  eyes-  gorgeous  colors  you  will  get  tons  of  compliments,  and  it  stays!  love  to  all  :)
__label__1 is  happy  for  the  new  year  and  is  excited  for  all  the  wonderful  things  that  are  here  now  and  are  in  the  future  :)  xoxo
__label__1 is  having  one  of  those  days,  but  thankfully  has  come  to  the  realization  that  moments  do  pass  and  tomorrow  is  a  new  day  and  the  problems  of  this  week  will  be  a  faded  memory  when  next  week  comes  around.
__label__1 soooooooooooooo  excited  to  see  *propname*  cause  she  rocks!  in  the  meantime  i  am  lmao  at  www.notalwaysright.com
__label__1 is  going  to  see  *propname*..wooo...is  going  to  see  *propname*...wooo!  so  psyched!!!!
__label__1 had  delicious  thai  food,  needs  to  clean  tomorrow,  and  is  excited  about  getting  busy  at  her  new  job
__label__1 is  looking  at  old  photos...and  is  kinda  glad  she  takes  them  off  facebook  every  so  often,  so  that  she  has  them  all  to  herself,  and  it  helps  her  make  sure  she  keeps  moving  forward    ;)
__label__1 is  pondering...how  many  people  pop  up  on  your  facebook  homepage  you  can  barely  recall  having  talked  to  in  the  last  year?  hmmm....life  it  changes
__label__1 is  lost,  but  in    hopefully  she  will  find  her  way  and  is  making  a  promise  to  put  herself  first  :)
__label__1 ugh  that  *propname*  has  the  face  of  a  nightmare...ewww
__label__1 wants  to  be  like  the  cute  old  couple  on  third  avenue  who  sit  outside,  rain  or  shine,  together  happily  watching  people  walk  by...
__label__1 has  been  a  negative  person  this  week,  and  although  the  week  is  not  up  yet  she  will  turn  it  around.  looking  for  hope  to  ward  off  the  restlessness
__label__1 black
__label__1 wants  to  pose  a  question...if  you  could  go  back  to  several  times  in  your  life  you  wish  you  could  do  differently  would  you?
__label__1 is  happy  things  are  coming  together  for  her  job  and  self-wise...is  a  lot  busier  than  she  realized...feels  good  about  keeping  her  resolution  to  be  selfish  to  herself...and  is  letting  other  people  make  the  effort,  and  it  is  great  :)
__label__1 is  sleepy,  loves  *propname*'s  new  blog,  *propname*'s  remodeled  blog,  *propname*'s  new  makeup,  and  is  so  pumped  for  new  moon!!!  did  she  mention  she  has  the  new  cd  and  loves  it?
__label__1 used  to  like  facebook  more,  but  it  just  is  not  the  same...maybe  it  is  time  to  change  things  up...
__label__1 is  fulfilled  in  life!  is  sooooo  excited  for  everything!  :)
__label__1 is  sleepy,  is  sooo  happy  and  content,  is  so  lucky  to  have  the  many  wonderful  people  she  has  in  her  life,  and  is  really  happy  to  have  the  opportunity  to  have  work  in  such  a  crazy  economy  :)
__label__1 has  a  bump  on  her  head  she  has  no  idea  where  it  came  from,  loves  the  cold  weather,  feels  like  a  weight  has  been  lifted  from  her,  and  is  confident  in  her  choices  here  on  out.

__label__0 trees  arrived.    weekend  "chore:"  plant  wonderful  pomegranate  tree,  all-in-one  almond  tree,  pawnee  pecan  tree,  and  stuart  pecan  tree.
__label__0 hard  drive  problem?    made  funny  noises  twice  and  failed  to  boot.    finally  booted  (obviously).    i  am  going  to  install  a  new  one  now.    don't  expect  updates  for  a  few  minutes  (hah!).    of  course  the  last  time  this  happened,  i  installed  a  new  drive,  used  the  old  one  for  backup,  and  the  old  continued  working  for  years.    so  this  could  all  be  a  waste  of  time  and  money.
__label__0 about  the  clutter.    *propname*  and  i  are  playing  farmville.    this  generates  messages  on  facebook,  messages  that  are  of  no  interest  to  anyone  not  playing.    to  stop  seeing  this  clutter,  follow  these  steps:  point  your  mouse  at  one  of  the  offending  items.    the  word  "hide  appears  in  the  upper  right.    click  the  word  "hide".    additional  options  appear.    click  "hide  farmville."  you  still  we  see  any  of  our  other  items.
__label__0 put  his  hat  on,  and  spent  much  of  the  afternoon  collecting  mesquite  and  yucca  seeds,  then  buying  them  all  over  the  place.    few  will  ever  sprout.    but  some  will.
__label__0 lunch:  salad,  with  tuna  and  dried  michigan  cherries.    thanks,  mom.
__label__0 is  sad  to  see  *propname*  go,  but  very  happy  he  was  able  to  be  here.
__label__0 *propname*  and  i  planted  four  trees  on  monday,  and  today  we  got  an  inch  of  rain.  there  are  two  pecan  trees  (to  pollinize  each  other),  an  all-in-one  almond  (two  varieties  grafted,  so  no  additional  pollinizer  needed),  and  a  pomegranate  (self-pollinizing).    life  is  easy,  sometimes.
__label__0 my  cat  is  looking  for  the  door  into  summer.

__label__0 note  in  my  homeowner's  insurance  policy:  "discharge  of  a  nuclear  weapon  shall  be  deemed  a  warlike  act,  even  if  accidental."    you  can  be  sure  that  i  will  call  and  complain  immediately  if  our  house  is  destroyed  by  a  nuclear  weapon.
__label__0 here's  what  i  tell  anybody  and  this  is  what  i  believe.  the  greatest  gift  we  have  is  the  gift  of  life.  we  understand  that.  that  comes  from  our  creator.  we're  given  a  body.  now  you  may  not  like  it,  but  you  can  maximize  that  body  the  best  it  can  be  maximized.  --mike  ditka  no  thanks.  --jcy

__label__0 if  you  find  yourself  wondering  about  things  such  as  "how  long  of  a  time  period  is  %  of  eight  hours?"  and  it  makes  your  brain  hurt  to  figure  it  out  in  your  head,  you  can  go  to  google  and  type  in  "%  of  eight  hours"  and  it  will  tell  you.

__label__0 no  one  should  die  because  they  cannot  afford  health  care,  and  no  one  should  go  broke  because  they  get  sick.  no  one  should  be  unable  to  change  jobs  because  of  a  "pre-existing  condition."  if  you  agree,  please  post  this  as  your  status  for  the  rest  of  the  day.
__label__0 shabbat  shalom!

__label__0 please  put  this  on  your  status  if  you  know  someone  (or  are  related  to  someone)  who  is  gay.  my  wish  for    is  that  people  will  understand  that  being  gay  is  not  a  disease:  people  who  are  gay  are  not  looking  for  a  cure  but  for  acceptance.

__label__0 was  told  today  (by  a  nurse  at  the  hospital)  that  "a  pastor  is  the  last  thing  she  would  take  me  for."  which  begs  the  question...what  is  the  first  thing  she  would  take  me  for?

__label__0 didn't  think  that  coming  to  take  care  of  the  water  heater  first  thing  in  the  morning  meant  ...i  guess  there's  still    mins  until  it  afternoon!
__label__0 just  had  a  wonderful  chat  with  *propname*  on  the  phone  and  is  about  to  start  making  dinner:)
__label__0 went  to  see  "the  hangover"  tonight  then  came  home  to  enjoy  a  nice  relaxing  jacuzzi  tub  bath  with  a  glass  of  wine...life  doesn't  get  much  better  than  that!
__label__0 for  once  i  meant  to  let  my  phone  battery  die  all  the  way  before  recharging  and  did  i  remember  to  plug  it  in  once  it  reached  that  point?  not  until  just  now...oops
__label__0 is  making  rice  krispies  treats!
__label__0 is  excited  to  have    more  new  books  from  paperback  swap  but  can't  decide  what  to  read  now!
__label__0 is  annoyed  that  gm  decided  it  would  be  cool  to  have  some  stupid  ass  bracket  for  wiper  blades  on  the  g  resulting  in  me  having  to  pay  $  for  replacement  blades.
__label__0 had  a  good  workout  at  the  gym  this  afternoon,  just  took  a  nice  relaxing  jacuzzi  bath  and  now  off  to  bed  with  fresh  from  the  dyer  sheets.  ahhhhh  fantastic:)
__label__0 the  first    atlantic  tropical  storms,  *propname*  and  *propname*,  have  formed.  i'm  not  too  worried  but  have  to  admit  there's  a  little  unease  about  the  idea  of  something  making  it  here.  afterall,  this  is  my  first  rodeo!
__label__0 *propname*  and  her  friend  are  coming  to  visit  me  next  weekend!!!  so  excited!!!
__label__0 had  a  great  day  with  a  wonderful  friend  and  a  wonderful  evening  with  a  great  boyfriend.  i'm  one  lucky  girl:)
__label__0 sometimes,  i'll  watch  a  movie  that  i  watched  when  i  was  younger  and  suddenly  realize  i  had  no  idea  what  the  f**k  was  going  on  when  i  first  saw  it.
__label__0 is  nervous  about  getting  cavities  filled  for  the  first  time  ever  tomorrow:(  the  up  side  is  that  it  probably  isn't  as  bad  as  repair  work  from  stepping  on  a  shovel;)  there  i  feel  a  bit  better  now!
__label__0 is  excited  about  dinner  and  movie  date  night:)
__label__0 how  many  times  is  it  appropriate  to  say  "what?"  before  you  just  nod  and  smile  because  you  still  didn't  hear  what  they  said?
__label__0 *propname*  brought  me  breakfast  in  bed  this  morning,  hanging  out  with  *propname*  later,  then  a  delicious  pineapple  pork  chop  dinner  made  by  *propname*  and  watching  a  movie..what  a  great  day  it's  going  to  be!:d
__label__0 if  *propname*  san  diego  and  *propname*  ever  got  together,  their  offspring  would  probably  just  be  completely  invisible.
__label__0 is  trying  to  decide  what  to  stock  the  fridge  with  so  there  is  a  chance  that  *propname*  will  eat  something  besides  fast  food  for    days  that  i'm  gone!  :)
__label__0 is  a  huge  nerd  and  posting  books  on  paperback  swap:)
__label__0 bad  news:  novocaine  is  wearing  off  so  my  mouth  is  hurting  a  bit  now.  good  news:  i  can  now  drink  my  pumpkin  spice  latte  without  dribbling:)
__label__0 is  glad  that  we  waited  to  watch  wolverine  as  a  rental.
__label__0 is  wondering  how  many  people  get  themselves  screwed  out  of  money  by  not  paying  attention  and  keeping  records  of  stuff.  i  just  added  another  $  to  my  "um  no  dumby  actually  i  don't  owe  you  that  money"  total.  yay  me:)
__label__0 i  like  all  of  the  music  in  my  itunes,  except  when  it's  on  shuffle,  then  i  like  about  one  in  every  fifteen  songs  in  my  itunes.
__label__0 "you  try  growing  up  in  a  trailer  park  with  nothing  but  dust  mites  and  lithuanians  and  see  where  that  gets  you"..a  line  from  a  terrible  movie  on  netflix  on  demand,  but  it  made  me  giggle
__label__0 is  off  to  the  gym!
__label__0 is  feeling  productive  after  posting  *propname*'s  care  on  autotrader.  if  anyone  is  possibly  interested  in  a    honda  civic  si  for  ~$  let  me  know.  i  will  post  the  link  too  once  it's  officially  up  on  the  site!
__label__0 off  to  the  store  to  get  the  things  i  need  to  make  caramel  apple  cookies.  i  hope  that  mine  turn  out  as  good  as  the  picture!  i  also  hope  that  they  have  the  caramel  bits  i  need  at  this  walmart!
__label__0 is  wondering  what  the  heck?  last  week  my  computer  hard  drive  died  and  just  a  few  minutes  ago  i  got  the  blue  screen  of  death  from  my  directv  box  saying  a  problem  has  been  detected  on  my  hard  drive.  not  cool.
__label__0 fantastic  day  of  hanging  out  with  friends  and  doing  some  shopping:)  relaxing  on  the  couch  reading  for  a  bit
__label__0 had  a  busy  day.  time  for  a  nap  before  possibly  carving  pumpkins  this  evening:)
__label__0 perhaps  *propname*  putting  off  getting  our  halloween  costumes  for  so  long  was  really  his  way  of  helping  me  find  my  awesome  costume  idea  :)
__label__0 happy  halloween!  almost  timet  to  make  some  snacks  for  the  party  tonight:)
__label__0 carving  pumpkins  with  *propname*...pictures  to  come  soon:)
__label__0 shooting  and  punching  some  stuff  in  borderlands:)
__label__0 just  heard  a  commercial  on  the  radio  about  some  pill  to  lower  cholesterol.  they  actually  said  "do  you  have  high  cholesterol  due  to  poor  diet  or  lack  of  exercise?  then  you  need  to  try  this"    no,  actually  you  need  to  try  improving  your  diet  and  exercising  a  bit  first.    just  a  crazy  thought  i  had...
__label__0 is  happy  that  my  new  hard  drive  is  installed.  yay!
__label__0 is  pretty  sure  i'm  coming  down  with  whatever  *propname*  considering  i  just  folded  a  load  of  towels  and  now  feel  completely  drained.    the  good  news  is  that  the  tv  is  working  again:)
__label__0 is  not  having  a  good  night.  watching  some  tv  then  heading  to  bed.
__label__0 is  making  some  grub
__label__0 is  not  happy  that  our  a//c  is  not  working.  grrrr
__label__0 just  finished  watching  "the  ugly  truth",  cute  movie:)
__label__0 has  a  cold:(
__label__0 just  finished  watching  "  dear  zachary:  a  letter  from  a  father  to  his  son".  it  was  a  pretty  good  documentary  but  very  emotional...i  suggest  having  tissues  nearby
__label__0 plans  to  sit  on  the  couch  watching  movies  all  day.
__label__0 almost  time  to  make  white  chicken  chili  with  cheddar  jalepeno  hushpuppy  crust.  it's  going  to  be  even  better  than  usual  'cause  we  finally  have  some  fall  weather  here!
__label__0 just  saw  a  commercial  for  rihanna's  //  interview  about  her  ordeal  with  *propname*...isn't  it  convenient  that  she  is  finally  able  to  talk  about  it  in  an  interview  aired  the  day  after  her  new  album  comes  out?
__label__0 is  watching  "the  proposal".  *propname*  and  *propname*...even  if  the  movie  is  crap  it  won't  be  a  total  waste:)
__label__0 is  excited  about  my  helicopter  shaped  cookie  cutter:)
__label__0 mmm  peppermint  mocha  coffee  creamer:)
__label__0 doing  some  online  christmas  shopping
__label__0 doesn't  know  what  to  make  of  the  fact  that  based  on  my  interest  in  tv  shows  like  "brotherhood"  and  "californication"  ,  netflix  has  a  recommendations  section  of  other  "dysfunctional  family  dramas"    this  includes  "dexter"  and  "rescue  me"  which  are  both  shows  i  watch.  oh  netflix  you  know  me  so  well.
__label__0 is  not  sure  what  the  repairman  fiddled  with  yesterday  to  get  some  warm  air  to  come  out  of  the  heater  for  a  while  but  i'm  pretty  sure  that  the  heat  is  still  not  working  quite  right  considering  that  after  running  for    hours  with  the  thermostat  set  to    it  is  still  only    in  my  house  and  there  is  cool..no  cold  air  blasting  out  of  the  vents...and  yes  it  is  on  heat  not  ac;)
__label__0 wasn't  very  impressed  with  "taking  of  pelham  "  although  i  was  amused  by  *propname*'s  character  talking  about  the  girl  he  took  to  iceland..a  lithuanian  ass  model  named  lavitika.    ha
__label__0 is  happy  to  have  a  new  working  directv  box.  i  can  open  the  guide  and  switch  channels  without  it  freezing....and  the  dvr  works.  i  can  now  go  back  to  waiting  until  a  few  minutes  into  a  show  before  i  start  watching  and  then  fast  forward  through  commercials!
__label__0 is  getting  very  excited  about  decorating  for  christmas!  we  are  heading  out  to  get  a  tree  and  all  that  fun  stuff  in  a  while:)
__label__0 is  off  to  the  gym  again.  i  tried  and  can't  think  of  a  valid  reason  not  to  go,  plus  my  legs  aren't  sore  are  at  all  from  yesterday.  i  will  will  thank  myself  for  this  later:)
__label__0 is  happily  watching  pixar  short  films  on  abc  family  while  my  dvr  records  *propname*  on  another  channel:)  oh  and  i'm  drinking  my  pumpkin  spice  coffee  too!  life  is  good!
__label__0 happy  thanksgiving  everybody!  i'm  thankful  for  friends  to  share  thanksgiving  with:)  now  time  to  make  some  yummy  food  to  share  later
__label__0 is  making  spaghetti  sauce.  yum!
__label__0 has  a  cold  and  is  curled  up  on  the  couch  resting.
__label__0 blue
__label__0 thanks  for  all  the  birthday  wishes  yesterday!  i  had  a  great  day:)
__label__0 can't  believe  it.  i  got  the  new  wii  fit  plus  game,  it  has  a  lot  of  fun  new  games  and  features.  however,  after  not  using  the  wii  fit  for  a  few  months  we  decided  to  do  the  fitness  test  stuff  again.  me(since  last  time):  +.  lbs,  still  a  healthy  weight  and  bmi,  wii  age  .  *propname*:  -.lbs,  reccommends  a  healthy  weight  of  gaining  lbs,  wii  age  .  on  the  positive  side,  i  have  lost    of  the    lbs  i  gained  over  the  holidays!
__label__0 was  annoyed  with  the  state  of  la  for  sending  a  notice  that  my  car  policy  was  cancelled  on  ////  even  though  that  is  just  my  renewal  date  and  they  lost  the  info  my  insurance  company  sent...oh  and  it  took  them    months  to  do  something  about  it.  my  grumpiness  was  fixed  by  talking  to  the  rep  at  progressive.  she  was  friendly  and  talkative,  like  a  less  annoying  version  of  the  girl  on  the  commercials.  thanks  *propname*!
__label__0 is  taking  *propname*  to  the  vet  for  her  annual  check-up.  i  know  it's  good  for  her  i  just  always  feel  a  bit  bad  because  she  hates  it  so  much  :(
__label__0 dear  louisiana  office  of  motor  vehicles  employees,  i  understand  that  you  probably  get  stuck  dealing  with  stupid,  annoying  people  on  a  regular  basis.    that  doesn't  mean  you  have  to  be  rude  to  everyone,  especially  not  the  friendly  people  like  me  darn  it!
__label__0 did  an  hour  long  workout  and  now  i'm  trying  to  convince  myself  to  vacuum  the  house.
__label__0 funny:  every  time  i  have  to  spell  a  word  over  the  phone  using  'as  in'  examples,  i  will  undoubtedly  draw  a  blank  and  sound  like  a  complete  idiot.  today  i  had  to  spell  my  boss's  last  name  to  an  attorney  and  said  "yes  that's  g  as  in...(  second  lapse)..ummm...goonies"
__label__0 has  recooped  from  working  out  and  has  caught  a  cleaning  bug!
__label__0 is  making  sweet  potatoe  split  pea  soup.  i  hope  it's  good!
__label__0 can't  believe  the  amount  of  mosquitos  outside  already.  boo!
__label__0 why  oh  why  do  i  let  myself  watch  animal  cops  shows?  i  just  end  up  feeling  a  mix  of  sadness  for  the  animals  and  almost  rage  towards  the  people  involved.
__label__0 set  my  calorie  goal  for  wii  fit  tonight  as  a  piece  of  fried  chicken....turns  out  it  takes  a  lot  of  work  to  burn  off  a  piece  of  fried  chicken!
__label__0 was  enjoying  my  morning  shower  until  one  of  those  stupid  saints  remixes  came  on  the  radio.  i'm  all  for  that  kind  of  thing  when  i  actually  go  to  games,  but  i'm  sick  of  hearing  it  in  regular  rotation  on  the  radio.
__label__0 a  bit  mean...but  damn  funny  sarchasm  :  the  gulf  between  the  author  of    sarcastic  wit  and  the  person  who  doesn't  get  it.
__label__0 is  watching  a  movie:)
__label__0 just  finished  playing  wii  fit  plus  and  burned  an  ice  cream  cone  worth  of  calories.  now  it's  ok  for  me  to  eat  an  ice  cream  right?  kidding:)
__label__0 accidentally  clicked  the  wrong  button  on  a  page.  sorry  for  sending  that  farmville  thing  to  everyone!
__label__0 the  feminine  version  of  the  name  *propname*  meaning  "the  woman."  basically  never  printed  on  magnets,  mugs  or  other  souvenir  paraphernalia.  often  mistaken  for  *propname*,  *propname*,  *propname*,  *propname*  or  *propname*.  my  name  is  *propname*,  not  *propname*,  dammit.  (urbandictionary.com,  type  in  your  first  name,  copy  and  paste  the  first  entry)
__label__0 is  off  to  bed  and  hoping  not  to  be  woken  up  by  things  flapping  and  crashing  from  the  crazy  wind  outside.  on  the  up  side  it's  going  to  be  in  the  -  range  for  the  next  week!:)
__label__0 feels  bad  for  my  sick  boyfriend.  i  know  he  feels  really  crappy  'cause  he's  sitting  still  and  not  playing  videogames!
__label__0 thinks  it  might  be  time  for  a  nap:)
__label__0 is  off  to  work  out.  i  don't  want  to  but  it's  been    days:(
__label__0 doesn't  think  the  changes  to  facebook  were  really  needed  but  honestly  i'm  more  annoyed  with  all  the  complaints  i've  seen  about  it.  you  get  it  for  free  so  if  that  means  every  once  in  a  while  you  have  to  deal  with  a  new  layout  well...deal  with  it!:)
__label__0 starting  to  make  some  delicious  snacks  to  enjoy  while  watching  the  superbowl  later
__label__0 is  home  from  the  lockport  mardi  gras  parade  and  is  ready  for  a  nap!
__label__0 really  wishes  that  my  old  doctor's  office  would  learn  how  to  do  math.  i  don't  appreciate  getting  rather  large  bills  for  amounts  that  bsbc  and  i  have  already  paid.  oh  and  thanks  for  putting  it  in  the    day  slot  so  i  get  to  stress  about  further  stupidity  on  your  part  resulting  in  a  bad  outcome  for  me.
__label__0 wonders  how  sick  bon  jovi  is  of  singing  this  song

__label__1 today  i  saw  an  old  woman  walking  across  the  bridge  by  sparty.  she  was  wearing  a  bright  aqua  colored  shirt.  right  behind  her  was  a  college  guy  wearing  a  t-shirt  of  the  exact  same  hue.  it  made  me  smile!  :p

__label__0 had  an  awesome  th.
__label__0 i  talked  to  a  guy  today  who  was  convinced  chemical  engineering  was  "mixing  elements  to  make  things  that  use  chemicals."  might  make  more  sense  if  he  didn't  mean  it  literally.  oh  well.
__label__0 who  wants  free  stuff?  the  more  i  get  rid  of,  the  less  i  have  to  move.  dresser?  coat  rack?  shelves?  desk?  bathroom  stereo?  really  people,  you're  doing  me  a  favor  by  just  taking  it.

__label__0 westbound  on  the  mass  pike  you  see  signs  for  springfield  and  albany;  almost  like  being  in  oregon.
__label__0 next  term  i'll  have  a  lab  and  get  to  do  science  every  day.  until  then  i  have  a  cube  and  get  to  do  homework  every  day.
__label__0 no,  i'm  sorry;  a  manometer  is  not  a  device  that  goes  off  when  *propname*  is  nearby.
__label__0 sure  hopes  venture  bros.  goes  into  season  .
__label__0 if  you  split  a  raw  almond  in  your  mouth,  the  halves  are  completely  smooth  on  the  inside.  why  does  this  never  lose  its  novelty?

__label__0 it'll  take  a  lot  of  convincing  before  i'll  even  think  about  watching  caprica.  reimagined  battlestar  can  kma.  i  might  change  my  mind  if  the  writters  demonstrate  they're  capable  of  keeping  the  plot  details  straight  through  the  whole  series.  thoughts  anyone?
__label__0 i  highly  reccommend  *propname*.  *propname*  rules.

__label__0 is  high  on  swing  dance.  'cept  it's  really  late  now...

__label__0 is  going  to  miss  you.
__label__0 had  a  dream  come  true!    last  night  i  dreamt  about  eating  a  cinnamon  bun,  and  today  i  ate  a  cinnamon  bun!

__label__0 hey  my  rhode  island  friends.    what  rocks  to  do  in  providence  and  what's  the  best  italian  place  in  the  city?
__label__0 is  sick  of  starting  letters  with  "dear."    my  friends  are  more  than  dear,  i'm  using  different  adjectives  from  now  on.    "anti-establishment  *propname*,  how  are  you?    signed,  *propname*."    screw  you,  convention!

__label__0 finds  fiction  much  more  interesting  when  you  imagine  the  same  actors  and  voice  actors  to  be  the  same  people  instead  of  different  characters.    holy  crap,  *propname*'s  father  is  liquid  snake!    hey  look,  obi-wan  kenobi  is  helping  don  quixote  liberate  the  arabs  in  wwi!
__label__0 wishes  all  of  his  cornellian  friends  good  luck  tomorrow!    enjoy  it,  it's  a  wonderful  place.

__label__0 is  one  iteration  closer  to  his  desired  solution.
__label__0 wonders  whether  anyone's  ever  done  an  etymological  history  of  onomatopoeia.    why  did  "oink"  become  so  popular  when  most  pigs  i've  seen  go  "reeee"?    why  did  "fap"  become  so  popular?    is  it  accuracy  or  something  else?    a  most  interesting  question...    any  linguistics  majors  in  need  of  a  paper  topic?
__label__0 never  gives  up,  never  surrenders!

__label__0 associates  russian  classical  composers  with  christmas,  for  some  reason.    not  just  the  nutcracker  stuff,  either.    it's  a  bit  odd...    especially  since  everyone  knows  santa  lives  in  finland,  not  russia.

__label__0 digs  giant  robots.
__label__0 dear  everyone:  crack  open  a  dictionary  and  start  using  "hypothesis"  and  "theory"  correctly  from  now  on.    it's  not  that  hard,  and  misusing  the  word  confuses  stupid  people  to  whom  i  then  need  to  listen,  which  makes  me  sad.    :  (
__label__0 lernas  esperanton!

__label__0 danced  again  last  night.    this  is  starting  to  become  a  pattern...
__label__0 remembers  a  time  when  he  was  able  to  easily  find  classes  because  the  school  actually  had  its  shit  together  and  managed  to  have  a  central  location  with  all  the  course  descriptions.

__label__0 s  ganache  is  delicious.
__label__0 dear  online  dictionary  makers,  let  people  search  the  text  of  the  entries,  not  just  the  entry  words.    make  your  dictionaries  more  like  a  human  brain.    let  me  search  "make  things  the  same"  and  find  words  that  include  those  words  in  their  definitions.    that  would  rock.  love,  *propname*
__label__0 i  have  enemies?    i  thought  these  things  always  just  happened...
__label__0 feels  weird  being  in  the  library  during  finals  week  as  a  patron...
__label__0 holy  crap  this  is  hilarious:  http:////www.standforchristmas.com//pages//home  just  read  these  reviews.    what  bigoted  morons  think  like  this?    read  the  "offensive"  ones.    they're  the  best.
__label__0 is  starting  to  wonder  whether  his  eyes  reflect  light  in  the  near-infrared  spectrum  or  something  that's  just  out  of  sight  for  humans  but  visible  to  cameras,  cuz  man,  if  i  only  had  photos  to  go  by  i  would  swear  my  eyes  are  red.
__label__0 and  now  all  i  have  to  do  is  pack!    hooray!    one  quarter  down,  two  to  go!
__label__0 is  filling  his  diaries  with  references  to  dinosaurs  and  bigfoot.    this  way,  when  the  world  ends  and  future  historians  have  only  my  diary  for  primary  sources,  they'll  think  that  at  least  the  world  was  awesome  before  it  ended.    if  you  care  about  tricking  the  future  into  believing  our  era  was  the  awesomest  ever,  i  encourage  you  to  do  the  same.    together,  we  can  do  it!
__label__0 i'm  home,  wheee!
__label__0 one  paper  submitted,  two  to  go.
__label__0 rip  hal  ...    i  think  your  successor  will  be  named  metal  gear.

__label__0 is  beginning  to  miss  chicago  and  his  friends  there...
__label__0 dreads  his  mortality  as  he  walks  the  empty  aisles  of  a  library,  admiring  the  volumes,  yet  knowing  his  life  will  never  last  long  enough  for  him  to  enjoy  them  all.
__label__0 let's  see  how  honest  my  fb  friends  are.  leave  a  one  word  comment  that  you  think  best  describes  me.  it  can  only  be  one  word.  no  more  than  one  word.  then  copy  &  paste  this  post  on  your  wall  so  i  can  leave  a  word  about  you.  this  should  be  interesting...
__label__0 wants  to  get  out  of  hyde  park.
__label__0 wants  to  be  the  very  best!    like  no  one  ever  was!

__label__0 went  out  for  dinner  with  a  man  who  just  happened  to  be  a  host.    true  story.
__label__0 hey  all!    my  american  phone  is  officially  off!    don't  call  or  text  it  anymore,  k?
__label__0 and  we  can  live  in  a  beautiful  world  hide  away  under  peaceful  skies.  we  can  survive  on  time  and  a  word  feel  the  nights  passing  by.
__label__0 i've  finally  gotten  around  to  uploading  all  of  my  japan  pictures  so  far.    i  know  there  are  an  unbelievable  amount  of  them  (forgive  me,  i  love  taking  pics),  but  enjoy  them!

__label__0 "the  greatest  happiness  is  to  scatter  your  enemy,  to  drive  him  before  you,  to  see  his  cities  reduced  to  ashes,  to  see  those  who  love  him  shrouded  in  tears,  and  to  gather  into  your  bosom  his  wives  and  daughters."
__label__0 i  always  make  it  a  rule  to  let  the  other  fellow  fire  first.    if  a  man  wants  to  fight,  i  argue  the  question  with  him  and  try  to  show  him  how  foolish  it  would  be.    if  he  can't  be  dissuaded,  why  then  the  fun  begins  but  i  always  let  him  have  first  crack.    then  when  i  fire,  you  see,  i  have  the  verdict  of  self-defence  on  my  side.    i  know  that  he  is  pretty  certain  in  his  hurry,  to  miss.    i  never  do.
__label__0 i  want  to  be  loved,  but  you  don't  seem  to  love  me  |  i'm  wandering  aimlessly  within  this  repetition  |  and  the  answer  i  found  is  only  one;  that  even  if  i'm  scared,  even  if  i'm  hurt  |  i'll  say  "i  love  you"  to  the  person  i  love

__label__0 lupin,  like  mr.  huttle,  has  original  and  sometimes  wonderful  ideas;  but  it  is  those  ideas  that  are  so  dangerous.  they  make  men  extremely  rich  or  extremely  poor.  they  make  or  break  men.  i  always  feel  people  are  happier  who  live  a  simple  unsophisticated  life.  i  believe  i  am  happy  because  i  am  not  ambitious.

__label__0 is  thanking  god  for  another  day  in  the  land  of  the  living.  for  tomorrow  is  not  promised.  a  harsh  reminder  that  we  have  a  limited  time  to  mend  broken  relationships  achieve  our  goals  and  be  with  the  ones  we  love.
__label__0 is  back!  and  better  than  ever!!!!  a  little  wiser  a  lot  stronger  and  much  happier  with  a  new  attitude!  :-)
__label__0 is  lovin  it!  all  i  have  to  do  is  sit  back,  enjoy  the  ride,  let  the  good  times  roll  and  my  destiny  is  here.  yep,  pretty  much!  :-)
__label__0 is  so  disappointed...why  do  i  always  have  to  be  right  about  these  things?
__label__0 knows  that  god  is  carrying  her.  without  him  this  would  be  too  much.  "keep  thy  heart  with  all  diligence,  for  out  of  it  are  the  issues  of  life.  (proverbs  :)  lord,  i  know  your  love  is  enough  for  me.  :-)
__label__0 "if  i  should  stay,  i  would  only  be  in  your  way.  so  i'll  go,  but  i  know  i'll  think  of  you  ev'ry  step  of  the  way...i  hope  life  treats  you  kind.  and  i  hope  you  have  all  you  dreamed  of.  and  i  wish  you  joy  and  happiness  but  above  this  i  wish  you  love....and  i  
__label__0 "out  of  the  abundance  of  the  heart,  the  mouths  speaks".  guard  your  words  at  all  times.  your  mouth  can  do  so  much  damage  to  you  and  those  around  you.  "the  tongue  is  a  world  of  iniquity,  set  afire  of  hell."
__label__0 word  of  the  day:  you  don't  have  to  settle  for  anything  or  anyone  in  your  life.  determine  what  you  don't  like,  pray  hard,  work  hard,  and  fix  it.  sometimes  its  just  easier  to  walk  away  and  start  over.
__label__0 is  saying  lord  take  my  hand,  cover  me  and  take  me  beyond  what  i  understand.
__label__0 is  thinking  that  some  people,  once  gone,  need  not  ever  come  back  into  your  life...ever.
__label__0 is  wondering  why  people  think  i'm  going  to  put  up  with  their  foolishness.  my  silence  is  not  ignorance.  yes,  my  price  tag  is  high,  but  the  rewards  far  exceed  the  costand  those  who  matter  will  put  in  the  work.  the  only  treasure  valued  is  the  treasure  worked  for.
__label__0 is  finally  doing  what  she  should  have  done  a  long  time  ago.  a  burden  has  been  lifted.
__label__0 is  so  happy  that  my  daddy  always  hears  and  answers  right  on  time!!!  i  love  my  jesus  and  he's  the  only  one  that  i  need!
__label__0 i  got  exactly  what  i  asked  for  and  it  hurts.  i  forgot  that  nightmares  are  dreams,  too.
__label__0 is  really  craving  some  bbq!  :-(  i  love  my  family  but  something's  gonna  have  to  change....
__label__0 is  starting  all  over  again....
__label__0 can  see  clearly  now  and  no  longer  focuses  on  the  closed  doors.  i'm  only  looking  at  all  the  open  ones  god  has  set  before  me.  "surely  or  only  goodness,  mercy,  and  unfailing  love  shall  follow  me  all  the  days  of  my  life  and  the  presence  of  the  lord  and  his  house  shall  be  my  dwelling  place  forever."
__label__0 "who  shall  lay  anything  to  the  charge  of  god's  elect?  it  is  god  that  justifieth...for  i  am  persuaded,  that  neither  death,  nor  life,  nor  angels,  nor  principalities,  nor  powers,  nor  things  present,  nor  things  to  come,  nor  height,  nor  depth,  nor  any  other  creature,  shall  be  able  to  separate  us  from  the  love  of  god,  which  is  in  christ  jesus  our  lord."  have  a  blessed  day!
__label__0 is  lmbo  as  this  last  uno  game  i  just  played!  but  really,  though?  time  for  bed,  long  day  tomorrow.
__label__0 is  comforted  and  content.  it  only  gets  better  from  here!
__label__0 had  dinner  with  one  of  her  favorite  teachers  and  is  finally  home....
__label__0 people  come  and  go  and  will  always  disappoint  so  i  only  invest  in  god.  lord,  i  belong  to  you  until  the  end  of  time.  i  just  wanna  be  close  to  you.
__label__0 two  weddings,  one  baby  shower  and  a  great  church  service  on  sunday!  a  weekend  full  of  love  and  encouragement  and  i  know  the  best  is  yet  to  come!  "all  things  work  together  for  the  good  to  them  that  love  god,  for  them  who  are  the  called  according  to  his  purpose."
__label__0 "and  still,  i  rise."
__label__0 is  excited  about  her  first  day  at  her  new  job  as  a  college  graduate!  this  is  gonna  be  a  fabulous  day!  this  is  the  day  that  the  lord  hath  made,  let  us  rejoice  and  be  glad  in  it!
__label__0 finally  graudated,  despite  the  weather.  thank  you,  jesus.  and  thank  you  all  for  your  love  and  support  and  thanks  to  my  love  who  came  out  to  celebrate  with  me  last  night!
__label__0 enjoyed  spending  time  with  one  of  her  favorite  people,  *propname*.  :-)
__label__0 has  to  start  all  over  again...
__label__0 is  done  with  facebook.  why  am  i  tagged  in  a  status  against  my  will?
__label__0 now  needs  another  costume  idea  for  the  's  party!
__label__0 is  not  ready  for  monday.
__label__0 just  found  a  new  way  to  annoy  coworkers:  drink  a  big  gulp  of  water  and  chew  as  you  slowly  swallow  it
__label__0 is  looking  to  hire  an  end  user  support  technician.
__label__0 feels  niceness  is  wasted  on  some  people
__label__0 wants  some  alertos  to  cure  this  hangover
__label__0 talking  to  the  two  little  guys  standing  on  my  shoulders  about  the  iphone
__label__0 the  best  winter  holiday  season  of  my  life  has  concluded
__label__0 hates  wearing  contacts  to  work.
__label__0 just  came  back  from  another  awesome  weekend  in  mammoth.
__label__0 go  to  urbandictionary.com  and  type  in  your  first  name.  then  copy  and  paste  this  as  your  status.  put  the  first  entry  for  your  name  under  comments.
__label__0 is  one  of  the  unlucky  ones  that  has  to  work  today.
__label__0   hours  til  lift  off
__label__1 is  excited  for  july  rd.
__label__1 is  rather  enjoying  her  little  vacation  in  oshkosh.
__label__1 is  getting  married  in  a  little  over  a  month
__label__1 isn't  sure  what  to  think  about  things.
__label__1 is  waiting  for  august  th  at  :.  horray  for  the  beginning  of  the  rest  of  my  life!
__label__1 has  cold  feet.
__label__1 is  terribly  confused.  it  feels  like  my  mind  is  warring  with  itself...
__label__1 is  thinking  hard  and  excited  for  her  new  xanga  layout!
__label__1 thinks  pipe  tobacco  is  way  better  than  cigarettes.
__label__1 doesn't  know  how  to  cope  with  all  of  this  stress...  i  think  i've  cried  about    times  in  the  last    days...
__label__1 continues  to  befuddle  herself.
__label__1 was  not  able  to  push  her  wedding  date  back  to  the  fourth  of  september.  the  presiding  judge  was  full-up.  the  date  remains  august  th  at  :.
__label__1 is  sick.....still.  and  possibly  jobless  in    weeks.  that  is,  if  no  more  positions  open  up  for  me  at  wal-mart.
__label__1 hopes  that  wal-mart  hires  her,  now  realizing  her  blouse  was  open  during  part  of  the  interview.
__label__1 maybe  a  kitty  would  be  a  good  christmas  gift  for  *propname*....
__label__1 still  getting  over  that  cold  from  last  week....  but  hey  at  least  everyone's  laid  off  the  "quit  smoking!"  bit....
__label__1 is  at  home  on  her  first  scheduled  day  off.  and  i'm  bored  out  of  my  mind.
__label__1 is  still  rather  fluish.
__label__1 is  thinking  that  the  poor  girls  doing  that  "single  ladies"  are  getting  dissed  too  much.  i've  seen  younger  girls  doing  lewder  dances  with  less  clothes.  seriously.
__label__1 would  work  a  spell  if  not  for  the  moon  being  void  of  course...
__label__1 is  sick  and  tired  of  people  who  comment  on  every  single  status  update,  no  matter  how  insignificant.  we've  been  here  before,  you  know  who  you  are.
__label__1 is  having  a  little  boy!
__label__1 bought  her    farmer's  almanac  today....  horray  for  not  having  to  write  down  every  single  sunrise,  sunset,  moonrise,  moonset,  and  void  of  course  pattern  for  next  year!  woot!
__label__1 stayed  home  from  work  to  take  care  of  her  hubby.  by  the  way,  the  yorkie  babies  are  so  adorable!
__label__1 thinks  that  she  needs  some  numbers  from  friends.
__label__1 needs  someone  to  drink  for  her  on  dec.  th  since  i'm  pregnant  and  can't...  lol
__label__1   more  days....  i'm  counting  down!  and  bah  on  all  you  snow-haters.  all  i  know  is  i  don't  have  to  shovel  this  year,  thanks  to  my  loving  hubby.  thank  you  hubby  :)
__label__1 is  still  sick.  oh  well.
__label__1 hm,  low-signal  internet?  works  for  me.
__label__1 i  don't  want  to  miss  this  weekend,  but  i  might  have  to....  shitty  weather  and  my  hubby  can't  work  today....  i  think  i  might  cry  cause  i  really,  really  wanted  to  go.....  why  did  i  ask  for  snow?  i  only  wanted  a  little!
__label__1 finally!  snow  in  reedsburg.  i'm  so  happy  there's  gonna  be  snow  on  my  birthday!
__label__1 just  woke  up  to  half  an  inch  of  snow  and  is  so  happy,  she's  going  outside  in  her  pajamas  to  sweep  it  off  her  porch!  that's  no  sarcasm  folks.....  i'm  really  excited.  :)    days!
__label__1 is  a  little  upset  about  the  amount  of  snow,  and  hopes  she  gets  enough  birthday  money  to  visit  her  parents  this  weekend.
__label__1 well,  reedsburg  certainly  has  an  interesting  way  of  plowing  the  streets.....    more  days.
__label__1 feels    months  pregnant....  but  really  i'm  only    //.....
__label__1 wonders  if  its  just  coincidence  that  mine  and  my  best  friend's  birthdays  are  exactly  twoo  weeks  apart.
__label__1 classes  start  //  at  :  pm.  i'm  so  excited!
__label__1 is  eating  stroganoff,  waiting  for  her  hubby  to  come  home  and  then  maybe  some  sleep.
__label__1   more  days....  i'm  counting  down!
__label__1 the  siren  in  reedsburg  keeps  going  off.  it's  not  the  normal  noonblast  siren,  it  sounds  like  an  air-raid  siren  and  continued  for    minutes.  can  anyone  tell  me  how  to  find  out  what  the  damn  things  mean?
__label__1 sleep>wake  up>eat>more  walls  and  floors!
__label__1 wishes  vampire  wars  didn't  take  so  long  to  put  monies  and  energy  back  to  your  character.
__label__1 taps  then  bed....
__label__1 sends  out  yuletide  greetings  to  all  her  friends!  i  love  you  all  and  have  a  very  merry  holiday!
__label__1 more  walls!  more  floors!  i  need  to  make  the  sims    even  more  amazing!!!!
__label__1 hopes  no  one  else  bought  a  baby  book  for  *propname*...  i'm  up  to  three  now!

__label__1 had  a  wonderiferous  birthday.  :)
__label__1 is  drowsy  still...  at  least  i  managed  to  get    hours  of  sleep  last  night...  a  rarity  these  days.
__label__1 found  out  the  used  put  out  a  new  album  this  past  year.  how  did  i  miss  that  one?
__label__1 is  a  little  upset  about  not  being  able  to  get  a  good  connection  all  day.  i'll  try  again  tonight....
__label__1 cody's  car  is  ghey.
__label__1 work  on  the  forum  is  done  for  today.....  now  time  to  get  lunch  for  me,  connor  and  the  baby  and  watch  wall-e  again.....
__label__1 going  to  be  another  long  and  boring  week.  so  glad  i  don't  have  to  go  anywhere  for  a  few  months  after  this  weekend.
__label__1 wishes  she  could  post  her  awesome  playlist  to  gaia  but  can't  figure  out  the  coding  for  it.
__label__1 actually  got  some  good  sleep  for  once  :)
__label__1 knows  what  connor  got  from  her....  he  is  such  a  little  drama  king,  screaming  bloody  murder  at  time-outs!
__label__1 sleepy......  >.>  working  on  the  forum.
__label__1 ugh...  i  hate  this.  why  is  sleep  such  an  issue  when  you're  pregnant?
__label__1 hates  facebook,  the  internet,  and  her  monitor.
__label__1 is  unloved  <//
__label__1 hopes  they  schedule  her  c-section  at  her  doctor's  appointment  on  wednesday.
__label__1 tommorrow,  i  turn  .  i'm  super  excited.  and  i  can't  wait  for    pm  to  roll  around.....  mercer,  here  i  come!
__label__1 it  never  fails...  i  go  to  lay  my  son  down  for  a  nap  and  someone  inevitably  begins  pounding  on  something,  making  it  impossible  for  him  to  sleep.
__label__1 they  got  me....  those  darn  zynga  games.....  so  addicting.....
__label__1 ////  *propname*  is  coming!
__label__1 i  need  a  massage.  now.  any  takers?
__label__1 i  should  have  gone  to  bed  earlier  than  :  am.....  guess  i  forgot  that  *propname*  was  going  to  be  up  at  ....
__label__1 hubby  is  sick,  connor  is  crabby.....  i'm  just  tired.
__label__1 finally  found  out  who  got  her  hubby  and  kid  sick...  and  is  pissed  that  she  didn't  find  out  until  her  son  started  puking.
__label__1 has  discovered  that  is  an  awful  idea  to  sleep  on  her  back.
__label__1 getting  my  son  to  take  a  nap  is  like  pulling  teeth.
__label__1 well,  my  kid  and  *propname*  are  better  now.....  just  waiting  for  it  to  hit  me...
__label__1 i  wanna  play  gf!
__label__1 i  think  my  part  of  the  rp  forum  is  done...  we  will  need  some  moderators  so  anyone  interested  please  send  a  meassage  to  me  on  here  and  i  will  get  you  set  up  with  an  account  and  send  a  linky....  thanks!
__label__1 pali  tank  ftw!
__label__1 absolutely  has  to  remember  to  call  matc  and  drop  her  class.
__label__1 i'll  be  back  tomorrow,  i'll  be  back  at  a  quarter  to  eleven.  i'm  half  drunk  and  i  can't  see  straight,  i  hear  a  zero  with  a  capital  "z".  you  got  me  singing  songs  from  the  balcony  as  the  city  crumbles  under  the  powers  of  an  evil  doctor  rocket  science  monster  with  capabilities  to  destroy  the  entire  universe.
__label__1 pants  on  the  ground!  pants  on  the  ground!  looking  like  a  fool  with  your  pants  on  the  ground!

__label__1 city  of  angels  hads  reconfirmed  my  belief  that  *propname*  is  awesome.
__label__1 is  tired.
__label__1 spent  another  sleepless  night  tossing  and  turning,  only  to  get  up  at    am  and  deal  with  a  kid  who,  i  swear,  has  the  loudest,  most  ear-piercing  scream  i  have  ever  heard  (and  uses  it).  to  top  it  all  off,  i  got  a  call  from  the  clinic  saying  that  i'm  anemic,  and  they  want  to  put  me  on  yet  another  iron  supplement  that  i  can't  afford.  ftw.
__label__1 going  to  the  in-laws  for  dinner  then  home  for  the  evening.
__label__1 can  finally  be  on  the  net  at  the  same  time  as  her  husband....  hooray!
__label__1 is  feeling  it.  >.>

__label__1 has  a  naughty  son.
__label__1 tried  to  shovel.  it  was  a  bad  idea.
__label__1 it's  been  a  good  week.

__label__1 only  one  level  left  on  grand  fantasia,  then  i  am  a  palidin!
__label__1 had  a  great  holiday.  hopes  the  new  year  will  bring  better  luck....
__label__1 new  profile  image.....  and  the  funny  thing  is,  now  that  i  think  about...  *propname*  is  a  lot  like  *propname*.....

__label__0 i  must  be  pregnant,  or  something.  it's  not  natural  to  have  hummus  cravings...

__label__0 is,  decidedly,  an  eloquent  drunk.
__label__0 ugh  i'm  hungry.  siren  song  -  bat  for  lashes.  take  me  to  the  riot  -  stars.  consolers  of  the  lonely  -  the  raconteurs.  running  up  that  hill  -  placebo.
__label__0 ugh.
__label__0 there  are  so  many  fucked  up  people  because  there  are  so  many  fucked  up  marriages  or  lack  thereof.

__label__0 it's  freaky.  my  brother's  only  two  inches  off  me.  eh,  he  still  has  freakishly  large  feet.  i  can  live  happy  with  that  abnormality  even  if  it's  not  accompanied  by  a  '"  frame.
__label__0 spent  all  day  watching  glee.  i  hate  it  and  love  it  at  the  same  time.  so  cheesy!
__label__0 was  anyone  else  off  school  today?  i  was  sure  nobody  would  be  able  to  get  in.  eh.

__label__1 finding  a  place  to  live  is  ridiculously  stressful

__label__1 no  one  should  die  because  they  cannot  afford  health  care,  and  no  one  should  go  broke  because  they  get  sick.  if  you  agree,  please  post  this  as  your  status  for  the  rest  of  the  day.
__label__1 chips  and  salsa  must  be  made  with  crack  or  heroin.  what  else  can  explain  my  addiction  to  it?
__label__1 i  know  this  is  old  news,  but  i  don't  think  *propname*  could  be  more  annoying  or  less  funny.
__label__1 bored  as  hell...
__label__1 loves  myth  busters.  now  i  can  double  dip  all  i  want!

__label__1 the  unemployed  life  is  a  strange  one,  i'll  tell  you  that...
__label__1 loves  rd  rock  from  the  sun  reruns
__label__1 ,  after  this  weekend,  kind  of  sort  of  maybe  feels  like  she  might  want  to  move  back  to  the  ie...
__label__1 wow...  what  a  weekend
__label__1 come  on  angels!
__label__1 needs,  wants,  yearns.
__label__1 hates  it  when  she  buys  stuff  at  one  grocery  store,  then  goes  to  another  store  for  something  the  original  store  didn't  have,  and  finds  that  all  the  stuff  she  did  buy  at  the  first  store  costs  less  at  the  second  store.  ugh.

__label__1 really  wants  to  study  at  a  library  or  coffee  shop  today,  but  nobody  will  want  to  sit  or  drink  coffee  next  to  a  girl  who's  coughing  up  her  lungs...
__label__1 happy  thanksgiving  all!

__label__1 just  got  home  from  riverside  to  find  less  than  a  block  from  my  apartment:  six  cop  cars,  a  huge  congregation  of  police  officers  (some  with  guns  drawn!),  and  a  helicopter  circling  the  area.  i  have  no  idea  what's  going  on!
__label__1 wants  her  stupid  sore  throat  to  go  away  already!
__label__1 excited  about  volunteering  tomorrow!  and  hopeful  about  my  job  interview
__label__1 this  cold  ain't  gonna  keep  me  from  line  dancin  my  boots  off  tonight!  yeehaa!
__label__1 "if  we  were  never  ill,  we  would  not  know  what  it  was  to  be  well.  if  we  never  knew  hunger,  we  would  take  no  pleasure  in  being  full.  if  there  were  never  any  war,  we  would  not  appreciate  peace.  and  if  there  were  no  winter,  we  could  never  see  the  spring."
__label__1 is  sick  and  wishes  her  mom  was  here  to  make  her  some  tea  and  chicken  soup...
__label__1 ,  for  the  first  time  since  she  first  arrived  on  facebook  years  ago,  started  to  fill  out  the  "personal  information"  section  on  her  profile.
__label__1 the  times,  they  are  a-changin...
__label__1 money  should  never  be  the  goal,  only  the  byproduct.
__label__1 is  beyond  pissed  at  *propname*  right  now...

__label__1 going  salsa  dancing  tonight...  hope  i  don't  embarrass  myself    :)
__label__1 doesn't  like  thunder  :(
__label__1 sometimes  wonders  (as  much  as  i  love  *propname*)  if  the  whole  nbc  vs.  *propname*  fiasco  is  actually  a  ploy  to  boost  ratings  and  get  better  guests  for  the  tonight  show...  because,  if  so,  it's  working...
__label__1 just  got  home  after  not  having  been  since  :  to  find  a  candle  still  lit  on  my  dresser...  oops...
__label__1 �the  god  i  believe  in  is  with  those  who  suffer,  doesn�t  punish  those  or  create  evil  for  those  who  are  already  suffering�
__label__1 started  the  day  off  right:  with  a  big  fat  ticket  from  the  #%$&*!@  los  angeles  police  department...
__label__1 finally  watched  the  final  episode  of  the  tonight  show  with  *propname*.  it  was  amazing,  and  *propname*'s  speech  brought  me  to  tears.  i  also  loved  hearing  that  he  and  i  have  something  in  common;  cynicism  is  my  least  favorite  quality,  too�  i�ll  miss  you  *propname*!
__label__1 it's  a  concept  that  represents  a  profound  shift  from  how  we  think  about  money  and  satisfaction  and  the  obligation  of  a  government  to  its  people.
__label__1 finished  her  taxes    :d
__label__1 needs  to  go  to  sleep  now!  going  rock  climbing  in  the  morning  (eek!)
__label__1 desperately  needs  a  job...
__label__1 take  a  nap  or  go  to  the  gym...  what  to  do  what  to  do...
__label__1 two  fire  trucks  just  pulled  up  to  the  apartment  building  across  the  street.  i'm  assuming//hoping  it's  not  an  extremely  urgent  matter  because  the  firemen  weren't  exactly  running  into  the  building,  more  like  moseying...
__label__1 had  a  wonderful  night!  hung  out  with  some  really  great  people  and  listened  to  some  really  great  music!
__label__1 "if  it's  true,  if  i  am  indeed  addicted  to  sadness,  i  absolve  myself  of  blame.  responsibility  rests  firmly  with  my  brain.  it  is  a  flawed  design.  worse  than  the    ford  pinto  and  just  as  dangerous."
__label__1 wishes  she  was  a  football  fan...
__label__1 from  urbandictionary:  "she  has  the  most  beautiful  eyes  and  hair.    she  smells  that  of  a  fall  evening,  and  her  voice  will  typically  seranade  you."  and  "a  really  sexy,  funny,  smart  girl  that  every  guy  wants.  'damn,  you  lucky  bastard,  your  gf  is  a  total  *propname*!'"    :d
__label__1 might  need  to  start  figuring  out  what  organs  she  can  sell  on  the  black  market...
__label__1 anyone  know  if  and  where  the  state  of  the  union  address  might  be  viewable  online?  i've  googled  it  but  can't  find  anything,  and  i  don't  have  tv  so  i  didn't  get  to  watch  it  live  :(
__label__1 new  goal  for  :  write  something  for  publication  and  actually  have  it  published.
__label__1 yay  blue  skies!
__label__1 just  interviewed  at  an  organization  whose  office  is  in  the  same  building  and  on  the  same  floor  as  the  production,  art,  and  writing  offices  for  mad  men.  pretty  cool  :)
__label__1 "...the  event  marked  a  major  shift,  what  i  might  call  a  'paradigm  shift'  if  i  were  the  kind  of  person  who  used  terms  like  'paradigm  shift'..."
__label__1 is  glad  hulu  has  the  entire  strangers  with  candy  series...  funny  stuff

__label__1 has  been  working  all  week,  it's  time  to  play  gonna  get  a  little  bit  sideways
__label__1 wicked  salacity  leads  to  anger  and  frustration
__label__1 you're  not  sure  that  you  love  me,  but  you're  not  sure  enough  to  let  me  go
__label__1 taking  one  step  forward  then    steps  back...story  of  my  life
__label__1 another  lonely  night  with  nothing  to  hold  on  to  but  memories  of  better  days...
__label__1 exhausted
__label__1 recovery  day
__label__1 ugh!  in  rough  shape
__label__1 don't  worry  about  the  people  in  your  past,  there's  a  reason  they  didn't  make  it  to  your  future.
__label__1 she  said,  "you  probably  don't  remember  me,"  i  said,  "only  every  other  memory."
__label__1 she  put  him  out,  like  the  burning  end  of  a  midnight  cigarette
__label__1 this  is  the  man  cave,  there's  no  women  allowed  in  here.  i  got  a  jerk-off  station  for  god's  sake.
__label__1 i  got  a  feelin'  that  tonight's  gonna  be  a  good  night!
__label__1 we'll  put  a  boot  in  your  ass,  it's  the  american  way
__label__1 southside  tonight...any  takers?
__label__1 let's  get  drunk  and  be  somebody
__label__1 just  livin'  the  dream
__label__1 findin'  a  steady  pay  check  for  next  year...
__label__1 lovin'  this  hawaiian  pizza!
__label__1 i  just  wish  i  could  take  back  that  kiss.  because  now  i  know...  it  was  the  taste  of  betrayal.
__label__1 whiteout!!
__label__1 credit  card  roulette  cost  me  $....fml!
__label__1 i'm  better  than  ya  ex,  gonna  be  better  than  ya  next
__label__1 psu  loss,  steelers  loss...my  life  is  in  shambles
__label__1 im  football,  southside...life  is  good
__label__1 <insert  depressing,  emo  lyrics  here>
__label__1 psu  this  weekend?  obvi!...
__label__1 don't  think  i  don't  think  about  it,  don't  think  i  don't  have  regrets...
__label__1 maybe  we  have  to  break  everything  to  make  something  better  out  of  ourselves
__label__1 football  all  day...that's  what  i  love  about  sunday's
__label__1 lovin'  life!
__label__1 shorty's  like  a  melody  in  my  head
__label__1 getting  some  much  needed  tlc  from  mom...and  the  trap  is  cleaner  than  ever,  which  is  nice!
__label__1 i-n-d-e-p-e-n-d-e-n-t,  do  you  know  what  that  means?
__label__1 ():  you  dropped  me  off  at  the  wrong  girl's  house.  (-):  there's  no  such  thing  as  a  "wrong  girl"  make  it  happen.  ():  alright  see  you  in  the  morning.
__label__1 cmu  football...is  there  anything  better?
__label__1 ugh!  rough  weekend!
__label__1 dying  of  dysentry...
__label__1 wpt,  yes  please!
__label__1 terrible  night!
__label__1 is  trying  to  justify  his  cmu  education  in  exchange  for  the  psu  atmosphere...not  really  working
__label__1 noddin'  my  head  like  'yeah,'  movin'  my  hips  like  'yeah!'
__label__1 just  got  pizza  delivered  to  my  house  in  pittsburgh  by  a  chick  i  went  to  high  school  with  in  coudersport...feel  so  much  better  about  my  life  right  now!
__label__1 "i  don't  feel  like  watching  football,  i  would  rather  watch  a  good  movie"--*propname*....manhood  in  question
__label__1 everyone  is  single  if  you're  willing  to  try  hard  enough
__label__1 phi  is  callin'  my  name!
__label__1 ready  for  the  long  weekend
__label__1 false  alarm.  still  invincible.
__label__1 state  blows  another  opportunity...shouldn't  have  expected  anything  else...
__label__1 i  am  officially  the  dumbest  person  in  the  entire  world...my  life  sucks
__label__1 chi-town  for  the  weekend!
__label__1 false  alarm...still  invincible
__label__1 is  it  may  yet?
__label__1 turkey  bowl  at  beaver  stadium...sick!
__label__1 i  guess  if  that's  what  you're  into...
__label__1 tailgating  in  the  wendy's  parking  lot  is  the  new  thing  to  do!!
__label__1 lmfao!
__label__1 lately  i've  been  hard  to  reach,  i've  been  too  long  on  my  own.    everybody  has  their  private  world  where  they  can  be  alone.  are  you  calling  me?  are  you  trying  to  get  through?  are  you  reaching  out  for  me?  i'm  reaching  out  for  you...
__label__1 tryin'  to  keep  the  streak  alive
__label__1 to  feel  your  pain,  you  feel  mine.  go  inside  eachother's  minds,  just  to  see  what  we'd  find.  look  at  shit  through  eachother's  eyes.
__label__1 man  date  at  hokkaido...smaaart!
__label__1 scars  heal,  glory  fades,  and  all  we're  left  with  are  the  memories  made.  pain  hurts,  but  only  for  a  minute.  your  life  is  short  so  go  on  and  live  it,  cause  the  chicks  dig  it
__label__1 needs  a  formal  date  for  friday  night...stat!
__label__1 cleveland  celebrating  birthdays  with  the  king,  new  years  in  the  'burg,  cruisin'  the  caribbean....gonna  be  a  nice  little  weekend!
__label__1 i'm  pretty  sure  there's  a  lot  more  to  life  than  being  really,  really,  ridiculously  good  looking.  and  i  plan  on  finding  out  what  that  is.
__label__1   and  sunny  in  jamaica,    and  sunny  in  grand  cayman....smick!
__label__1 puzzling  my  face  off!
__label__1 women  lie,  men  lie,  numbers  don't  lie!
__label__1   rounds  of  credit  card  roulette  shots  and  never  had  to  pay...love  that!
__label__1 trapp  mandate...dinner  and  a  movie,  does  it  get  any  better?
__label__1 fml!!
__label__1 composing  a  script  for  greek  sing....will  most  definitely  be  epic!
__label__1 ridiculous!
__label__1 hang  on  tight,  cause  it's  gonna  be  wilder  than  any    second  ride
__label__1 jammin'  some  *propname*  on  the  new  trapp  piano!
__label__1 all  the  classy  broads  hit  up  half  price  wine  night  right?...
__label__1 best.  wedding.  ever.  i  love  you  to  death  em  and  col!
__label__1 who's  gonna  see  the  harry  potter  movie  with  me?  the  person  who  comes  is  still  allowed  to  judge  me.
__label__1 is  sick  =(
__label__1 ,  kleenex  and  some  codeine  later,  kea  rejoins  the  world  of  the  living...
__label__1 took  the  first  step  toward  developing  a  green  thumb  today.  windowbox  basil,  anyone?
__label__1 good  god,  vacation  can't  get  here  soon  enough.  here  i  come  sun,  sand,  fresh  seafood,  and  pleasure  reading!
__label__1 well,  it  finally  happened:  i  bought  a  coffee  so  big  it  didn't  fit  in  my  microwave  for  re-heating.  (sub-status  update:  go  to  bing.com  for  some  major  boston  pride  ;-)
__label__1 enjoying  the  lovely  golden  weekend!
__label__1 couldn't  hate  these  new  gap  commercials  more.  they  are  seriously  the  devil's  handiwork.
__label__1 s  dream  of  a  roof  garden  will  not  be  dashed,  gosh  darn  it!
__label__1 is  pretty  inspired  by  how  active  (and  cool)  some  of  her  geriatrics  patients  are...
__label__1 so  like,  what's  the  deal  with  *propname*?  i  think  i'm  missing  a  basic  understanding  of  this  cultural  phenomenon.
__label__1 did  anyone  else  think  it  was  obvious  *propname*  and  *propname*  were  getting  a  divorce  like    seasons  ago?
__label__1 life  is  so  good!  medicine  rocks  and  i  am  so  proud  of  my  man  for  his  stellar  performance  review  today.  here  comes  the  first  latino  microsoft  ceo,  watch  and  wait.
__label__1 the  roof  garden  is  born!  will  post  pics  after  a  dinner  made  with  our  very  own  herbs  =)
__label__1 hates  saying  bye  to  *propname*=(
__label__1 apparently,  all  it  takes  for  me  to  go  on  a  semi-psychotic,  cockroach-killing  rampage  is  two  glasses  of  wine  and  a  strategically  placed  dansko.
__label__1 ok,  the  new  *propname*  &  *propname*  is  kind  of  amazing.  now  who  is  coming  with  me  on  //?
__label__1 very  slowly  meandering  my  way  toward  garden  bliss.  does  anyone  in  philly  have  a  patio  umbrella  they're  trying  to  rid  themselves  of,  by  chance?
__label__1 days  becoming  so  much  shorter...
__label__1 hooked  on  weeds  without  any  way  of  getting  my  next  dose  soon.  damn  you,  netflix  instant  queue  and  your  empty  promises.
__label__1 if  this  societal  obsession  with  vampires  had  happened  while  i  was  going  through  my  "phase"  in  middle  school,  it  really  could  have  changed  my  life.
__label__1 good  luck  on  shelves  tomorrow,  friends!
__label__1 out  into  the  cool  fall  air  for  lots  of  mocha  and  a  little  studying.
__label__1 never  appreciated  how  good  a  dancer  *propname*  was  until  the  recent  marathons  of  dirty  dancing.  kudos  where  kudos  are  due.
__label__1 anyone  interested  in  joining  me  for  *propname*  y  *propname*  on  oct.    at  the  electric  factory?  ticket  are  $  =(  but  i'd  go  with  good  company!
__label__1 s  mind  was  just  completely  blown  by  the  awesomeness  of  zahav  (israeli  restaurant  here).  easily  in  the  top  three  restaurants  i've  eaten  at,  worldwide.  go  there.  now.
__label__1 enjoying  the  nostalgia  of  fall...
__label__1 hi,  fall.
__label__1 how  about  getting  to  bed  early?  anyone  want  to  jump  on  the  bandwagon?
__label__1 forty-five  minutes  on  a  rittenhouse  bench,  with  a  bag  full  of  veggies  and  la  colombe  mocha,  really  turns  the  day  around  =)
__label__1 just  had  chicken  mcnuggets  for  dinner.  this  is  a  new  low.  and  it's  called  "short  call  at  chop."
__label__1 just  burned  out.
__label__1 q  overnight  call  at  chop  tomorrow.  poopie.
__label__1 forgot  how  much  she  missed  house  until  she  saw  the  premiere.  love  it.
__label__1 thinks  it  feels  pretty  fly  to  see  her  tiny  shoots  of  arugula  (and  spinach,  kale,  and  two  types  of  lettuces)  battling  the  odds!
__label__1 hm.  apparently  running  for  the  first  time  in  months  makes  me  simultaneously  feel  like  horse  $#!@  and  want  to  devour  a  steak.  wasn't  prepared  for  that.
__label__1 how  did  fall  completely  slip  through  the  crack  between  summer  and  winter?
__label__1 maybe  i  should  have  bing'd  whether  staph  aureus  toxin  is  inactivated  via  boiling  before  boiling  and  eating  the  soup  i  left  out  for    hours.
__label__1 *propname*  at  ritfit  is  my  new  favorite  person.  it's  kinda  nice  to  be  cajoled  into  thinking  you're  "way  stronger  than  you  think"  at  doing  bicep  curls.  and  that's  what  i'm  paying  him  for.
__label__1 just  scared  myself  senseless  by  watching  most  of  dracula.  i  am  such  a  bigger  pansy  than  i  used  to  be,  back  in  my  vampire-obsessed,  middle-school  days...
__label__1 sick  day  today  =(
__label__1 weekends  go  by  so  quickly...  =(
__label__1 no  wonder  *propname*  *propname*  *propname*  dumped  *propname*.  his  song  about  her  is  horrendous,  even  for  a  s  ballad.  now  i  understand  that  *propname*  is  a  (marginal)  step  up  for  her.  *shudder*
__label__1 had  about  l  of  insensible  losses  via  mouth-breathing  last  night  and  woke  up  with  a  tongue  the  consistency  of  beef  jerky.  this  viral  uri  can  stick  it  up  its  tiny  viral  you-know-whoosy.
__label__1 holy  crap.  i  am  in  love  with  you  *propname*  y  *propname*.  in  love  with  you.
__label__1 turned  the  heat  on,  finally.
__label__1 can't  taste  her  food  and  is  officially  pissed  at  her  uri.
__label__1 somtimes  you  just  gotta  laugh.
__label__1 finally  drove  out  the  dust  ponies.  they  were  becoming  too  domesticated  and  needed  to  be  set  free  in  their  natural  habitat.
__label__1 needs  free  and  lazy  costume  ideas.  the  polls  are  open!
__label__1 has    times  more  respect  for  *propname*  after  her  crazy  bra  lady  moves.  herioc  indeed.
__label__1 watched  in  shock  today  as  a  nurse  on  the  bus  poked  and  yelled  at  an  old,  disabled  man  for  sitting  too  close  to  her  in  the  section  designated  for  old  and  disabled  people.  wishing  i'd  said  something.
__label__1 buy  a  christmas//hannukah//kwanzaa//solstice  tree?  check.  get  step    books?  check.  start  dinner  before  pm?  check.  it's  really  amazing  what  we  can  accomplish  when  we're  let  out  of  surgery  early!
__label__1 sunday  blues.
__label__1 i  recounted  my  nap-dream  to  raf  just  now.  he  recounted  that  he  wanted  to  shoot  himself  in  the  face.  apparently  the  narrative  was  much  more  exciting  and  dramatic  in  my  head...
__label__1 note  to  self:  trying  to  rekindle  an  old  flame  for  string  cheese  is  not  well  accomplished  using  low-salt,  skim  mozarella  sticks.
__label__1 not  only  is  dracula  good,  but  batman  forever  is  still  amazing.  i  had  such  good  taste  in  movies  as  a  high  schooler,  holy  crap!  and  now  i  like  the  holiday?!
__label__1 christmas  tree  decorating.  *propname*  of  the  bells.  potentially  cocoa  and//or  holiday  cookie  baking.  i  am  officially  the  worst  jew  ever.
__label__1 is  anyone  else  kinda  suffering  through  this  elective  ranking  process?  i  spent  months  obsessing  over  the  exciting  possibilities,  and  now  all  i  want  to  do  is  avoid  it...
__label__1 halfway  done  with  med  school  and  off  to  the  outer  banks  for  two  weeks.  limited  access  to  phone  and  e-mail,  but  will  check  when  i  can!  congrats  classmates!
__label__1 *propname*  has  officially  caused  my  imminent  failing  of  ob//gyn.  i  have  spent  a  cumulative  day  reading  "the  hunger  games"  and  its  sequel,  "catching  fire"  in  the  last  week.  and  now  i  can't  study  because  i'm  pining  for  the  final  book  in  the  series,  which  won't  come  out  til  august.  damn  you,  *propname*,  and  your  cruel  attempt  to  get  me  reading  again!
__label__1 brokeback  is  officially  the  most  depressing  movie  of  all  time.
__label__1 thank  you,  case  files.  if  it  weren't  for  you,  i  wouldn't  know  what  to  expect  when  undergoing  "the  menopause."
__label__1 home  sweet  turkey!
__label__1 sunday.  *propname*  gone.  and  the  person  standing  in  line  behind  me  at  the  minimart,  who  saw  me  paying  with  a  bill  that  had  a  giant  inappropriate  anatomical  figure  on  it,  was  a  pastor.  of  course.
__label__1 me:  "omg  i  am  tired  after  two  robotic-assisted  laparoscopic  hysterectomies  with  bilateral  salpingoopherectomies.  *propname*:  "awesome  i  did  a  fatakanicous  dilopidous  internal  rectomy  today  too."  i  pity  the  fool  who  is  forced  to  date  a  med  student.
__label__1 t-  days  til  st.  john  and  leaving  *propname*  til  march.  i  just  realized  how  weird  this  feels.
__label__1 mmm.  nothing  like  tea  and  galetti  to  transport  me  back  to  early  morning  breakfasts  in  florence.
__label__1 "cuz  when  the  roof  caved  in  and  the  truth  came  out  i  just  didn't  know  what  to  doooo,  but  when  i  become  a  star  we'll  be  living  so  large  i'll  do  anything  for  youuuu...".  on  repeat.  i  don't  care  if  this  makes  me  a  loser.
__label__1 got  a  white  christmas  of  her  own:  hilltop  house  engulfed  in  a  cloud  all  day!  thx  for  pulling  through,  st.  john  ;-)
__label__1 santa  must  love  me;  st.  john  bound  in  t-  days!
__label__1 if  there  had  been  a  real  fire  tonight,  everyone  in  my  building  (including  me)  would  be  burned  to  a  crisp  right  now  because  apparently  a  fire  alarm  isn't  enough  to  lure  us  from  our  dens.
__label__1 wishes  the  weekend  would  never  end  =)
__label__1 waiting  for  a  batch  of  homemade  peppermint  bark  to  set  in  the  fridge  to  help  ring  in  the  new  year!  suck  it,  williams  sonoma,  with  your  exorbitant  prices!
__label__1 wouldn't  mind  if  a  philly,  nyc,  or  boston  friend  posted  pics  of  the  snowy  city  to  fb!  c'mon,  give  a  girl  a  white  christmas  =)
__label__1 kea:  for  the  love  of  god,  i  am  begging  you  to  return  those  heinous  brooks  brothers  shirts.  *propname*:  well  your  face  is  heinous.  and  i  don't  ask  you  to  return  that.  (just  another  morning's  playful  banter  between  someone  studying  for  step    and  someone  fighting  off  an  awful  cold...)
__label__1 finally  caved  and  saw  avatar.  as  i  suspected,  real  life  now  looks  bland  and  -d.  =//
__label__1 just  canceled  out  the  vote  of  an  obnoxious,  be-cashmere-scarved  prettyman  chanting  "*propname*,  hare  krishna,  *propname*"  in  the  middle  of  starbucks.  health  care  for  all!
__label__1 here's  hoping  the  house  and  senate  can  reach  some  sort  of  agreement...
__label__1 almost  just  passed  out  in  the  library  trying  to  test  my  valsalva//baroreceptor//hr  reflex.  and  no,  my  reflex  is  not  intact,  thankyouforasking.  frick!
__label__1 is  officially  more  than  halfway  done  studying  for  step  .  yikos.
__label__1 just  completed  her  night  cheese  ;-)
__label__1 would  rather  be  potting.  even  after    hours  in  the  studio  this  weekend...
__label__1 s  library  nemesis  has  answered  her  pine  nut  brittle  with  chips,  a  paper  lunch  bag,  and  a  thinly-veiled  apology  for  his  "snack  attack."  touch�,  library  nemesis,  touch�.
__label__1 just  found  a  blue  rubber  band  in  her  pork  wonton.
__label__1 really,  usmle  world?  you  really  want  me  to  know  which  growth  factor  receptors  have  intrinsic  tyrosine  kinase  activity,  and  which  ones  need  jak//stat  for  signal  transduction?  i  poop  on  you.
__label__1 i  hate  to  disappoint  you,  but  my  rubber  lips  are  immune  to  your  charms.
__label__1 .  kea:  a)  one  who  has  an  excessive  amount  of  cool  b)  a  verb  showing  that  someone  is  doing  something  sick  c)  a  person  filled  with  self-loathing  for  actually  following  this  fb  fad
__label__1 meh.
__label__1 ok,  *propname*.  you  only  get  to  name  one  disease  with  a  name  that  ridiculous.  come  on!
__label__1 can't  decide  if  it's  good  or  bad  that  med  students  score  worse  than  a  monkey  randomly  choosing  an  answer  for  some  of  these  usmle  questions...
__label__1 just  typed  "loves    rock  so  much  it  hurts  sometimes"  into  the  fb  search  box.  i  think  i'm  hemorrhaging  brain  cells  at  this  point.
__label__1 had  a  dream  last  night  that  i  defied  the  laws  of  the  space-time  continuum.  isn't  that  like  the  holy  grail  of  dreams?
__label__1 who  dat?!
__label__1 seriously  going  insane.  actually  wishing  i  could  move  up  my  date  to  spare  myself  the  psychological  nightmare  of  last-minute  usmle  studying.
__label__1 thinks  one  of  her  library  nemeses  is  trying  her  own  emergency  tactic  on  her,  namely,  faking  a  horrendous  cough  to  drive  others  away.  oh,  it's  on,  bitch!
__label__1 caved.

__label__0 misses  the  the  sound  of  the  wind's  voice  and  the  whispering  of  the  tree's
__label__0 the  key  to  realizing  a  dream  is  to  focus  not  on  success  but  significance  -  and  then  even  the  small  steps  and  little  victories  along  your  path  will  take  on  greater  meaning.

__label__0 read  *propname*'s  "check  raising  the  devil"  in  one  sitting  and  enjoyed  it.    an  honest  look  into  his  life,  and  glimpse  into  the  sometimes  fun  and  sometimes  dark  side  of  vegas  &  gambling.    also  watching  "the  universe"  dvd  set  still...  it's  amazing.    if  you  lik

__label__0 is  playing  the  ftops  main  event  in  his  hotel  in  nice...  trying  to  stay  patient  tho  i'm  tired  from  a  day  of  travelling  and  just  want  to  sleep.    tomorrow  i  go  for  a  week  on  a  yacht...  more  r&r  +  fun  people  +  a  whole  lotta  gambling...  sounds  like  a  slice  of  heaven.
__label__0 is  posting  this  from  ,  feet  above  the  surface  of  the  earth,  somewhere  over  nebraska  in  an  airplane.    wow,  what  an  amazing  world  we  live  in!
__label__0 wow...  so  many  cool  stories...  boats  r  fun  i'm  now  in  cannes  for  the  tournament  coming  up  in  a  couple  days.    ...  getting  a  little  homesick,  been  gone  almost    months
__label__0 did  full-fledged  bikram  for  the  first  time  (a  -minute  class  as  opposed  to  the    minute  classes  i  had  already  done)...  and  it  was  hard!    damn,  i  feel  great  now  though  =)
__label__0 is  thinking  maybe  he  needs  to  go  visit  peeps  at  some  point  in  cali  now  that  he's  single  and  has  no  excuse  not  to.    holla  san  francisco  &  san  diego  =)      ...  just  gonna  add  that  to  my  todo  list  here...  get  around  to  that  at  some  point...  (wow  im  hopeless)
__label__0 has  a  big  bet  on  the  wsop  final  table...  i  bet  on  *propname*  to  win  vs  *propname*  to  win  against  *propname*.    any  other  winners  is  a  tie.  i  figure  *propname*  is  about  :  &  *propname*  is  about  .:  i  loooove  my  bet  right  now  (no  odds!)    i  wanted  to  book  more  action  last  night  vs  *propname*  when  i  saw  him  at  the  bellagio,  but  he  doesn't  like  his  side  anymore.    ship  the  ev  kidd!!!!!
__label__0 feels  like  doing  things  is  hard.
__label__0 wow  -  i  just  played  codmw  all  night  with    buddies...  i  felt  like  i  was  back  in  college
__label__0 thanks  to  my  mom  for  an  amazing  feast...  i  just  crashed  out  afterwards  and  caught  up  on    hours  of  sleep.    now  i'm  up  early  in  poway  and  ready  to  go!    who's  out  there???
__label__0 k  at  bellagio  today...  off  to  the  races
__label__0 just  went  paintballing  in  sd...  always  a  great  time!    the  bruises  go  away  after  a  few  days,  but  the  memories  of  capping  your  friends  last  a  lifetime.
__label__0 thanks  to  the  beauty  of  anythingyouwantdelivery.com  ...  i  have  callofdutymw  on  the  way  right  to  my  place  right  now,  for  just  a  small  delivery  charge  (along  with  some  chipotle)...  i've  been  hearing  amazing  things  about  it  (best  fps  since  counterstrike)...  and  i  might  have  to  do  a  little  gaming
__label__0 what  a  night  last  night...  my  liver  took  one  for  the  team
__label__0 is  on  a  mission  in  the  gym.    my  body  is  changing  daily,  and  i  feel  and  think  better  then  i  have  in  a  while.    exercise:  the  only  healthy  drug!
__label__0 is  currently  reading  fooled  by  randomness...  today  i  put  my  book  down  in  the  midst  of  a  reverie  at  my  airplane  window  and  felt  as  if  my  brain  were  a    bad  sieve,  realizing  that  i  was  bound  to  forget  most  of  the  wonderful  things  i  was  reading...  if  only  i  could  remember  everything  useful  that  i've  learned  and  forgotten.
__label__0 does  not  know  anything  about  the  destruction  of  any  rvs  outside  of  las  vegas  in  the  desert.
__label__0 current  favorite  song:  chainside  -  i  would  die  for  you  (club  mix)
__label__0 back  in  san  diego  for  xmas
__label__0 is  a  relatively  short  stack  going  in  to  day    of  the  bellagio  k  tourney...  about  to  leave  to  go  play  now.
__label__0 finished  fooled  by  randomness...  it's  an  excellent  book  that  i  would  recommend  to  anyone.    i'm  now    pages  into  chaos  by  *propname*  and  am  enjoying  it.    go  reading!
__label__0 thinks  backgammon  is  fun!!
__label__0 is  up  a  little  too  early  in  the  morning  (:am)...  and  doesn't  know  what  to  do  with  himself.    i  think  i'm  going  to  get  some  quality  reading  time  with  chaos  (*propname*)...  btw  there  is  a  scale  for  the  quality  of  your  reading  (how  focused//distracted//tired,  etc...),  and  right  now  i  think  my  reading  will  be  pretty  solid
__label__0 is  stoked  bc  a  big  grocery  store,  a  nice  gym,  and  a  pinkberry  (best  after  workout  carbs  ever..)  are  all  within    block  of  my  penthouse  in  ipanema.    not  to  mention  the  beach  is  a  few  blocks  away.    i  am  about  to  go  to  all  those  places  and  then  the  beach...  i'm  in  heaven
__label__0 what  a  beautiful  life...  my  family,  my  friends...  amazing.  if  i  could  have  one  "genie  in  the  bottle"  wish,  not  including  any  kind  of  life  extension,  i  think  i  would  take  perfect  knowledge.    i.e.,  complete  knowledge  of  everything  already  known  and  possibly  knowable  to  the  human  mind  (excluding  future  events)
__label__0 taking  care  of  last  minute  business...  because  tomorrow  i'm  going  to  brazil  =)
__label__0 missed  my  connecting  flight  from  atlanta  to  rio  last  night,  i  now  have  to  spend    hours  in  atlanta  to  catch  the  same  flight  later  today.    it's  under  freezing  here,  and  i  have  no  long-sleeve  tops  and  a  single  pair  of  jeans.    hello  hotel  room!    time  for  movies!    i  think  i  might  be  coming  down  with  a  cold  too...  wow,  i  hope  it's  a  quick  one  that  just  goes  away.

__label__1 after  spending  time  on  watching  code  geass  instead  of  doing  my  pw...  i  realised...  that  is  was  soooo  worth  it...  best  anime  show  ever...  fuck  the  ending...  ugh...
__label__1 its  over  !!!@#$%^&!!  :d
__label__1 believes  that  life  is  like  the  open  sea,  and  truth  is  the  wind  in  our  sails.  (no  wonder  i'm  not  moving)
__label__1 i  suck!
__label__1 just  experienced  water  rationing.  it  was  fun.  it's  what  happens  when  construction  workers  screw  up  and  break  the  water  pipe  for  your  block...  lol  (no  water  the  whole  day  today  and  tomorrow)  :o
__label__1 just  had  an  awesome  friday.  like,  seriously...  haha

__label__1 nothing  comes  to  my  mind...
__label__1 realised  that  he  is  actually  a  virgo...  lol
__label__1 there  is  no  emotion;  there  is  peace.    there  is  no  ignorance;  there  is  knowledge.    there  is  no  passion;  there  is  serenity.    there  is  no  death;  there  is  the  force.
__label__1 thanks  to  some  random  person  in  my  class  having  hn,  my  exams  have  been  postponed  for  like...  a  entire  week!!!  so  now...  back  to  warcraft...  and  imma  panic  later  xd

__label__1 thanks  everyone,  for  the  birthday  wishes,  appreciate  it  (:
__label__1 wants  the  world  to  hurry  up  and  end  already.....
__label__1 reflecting  upon  an  entire  week  of  school  break:  -  good  news  -  i  cleaned  my  room!  -  bad  news      -  that  was  about  the  only  beneficial  thing  i  did  the  entire  week.....  conclusion:  i'm  sooooo  screwed.....  >_>
__label__1 he  who  has  not  found  something  which  he  would  die  for  has  no  right  to  live.
__label__1 after    hours  of  online  reading  and  research,  i  have  diagnosed  myself  to  have  a  type  of  red-green  colour  deficiency,  under  anomalous  trichomy,  called  deuteranomaly.    life  sucks!  ...
__label__1 so  many  words  and  faces...  so  many  different  voices...  where  do  they  lead...
__label__1 i  love  chaos,  for  most  are  consumed  by  it,  blind  to  its  hidden  beauty,  allowing  me  excludibility  to  revel  at  its  magnificence.
__label__1 i  officially  have  got  nothing  to  do  ...  at  all...  like...  seriously...
__label__1 weak  hearts  faint,  when  troubles  rises.  brave  hearts  soars,  steals  all  the  prizes.  false  heart,  it  shrinks  small  in  peace.  and  finds  in  fear,  no  sucrease.
__label__1 it  has  been  confirmed...  i'm  going  to  poly!  >=d  now...  to  find  a  job  while  i  wait...  >.>
__label__1 the  americans  have  forgotten  that  they  were  once  terrorists  to  the  british  ~
__label__1 can't  believe  he  overslept  today...  of  all  days...  ~.~  the  day  of  reckoning  is  at  hand!  xd
__label__1 never  thought  that  he  would  see  the  day  where  he  would  wish  for  failure.
__label__1 the  world  is  so  desperate  nowadays  that  the  promise  for  peace  can  win  a  man  a  nobel  prize.  let's  hope  that  he  keeps  his  word.
__label__1 i  need  to  get  a  shirt  that  says,  "i  don't  speak  chinese!"  ...  like...  seriously...  ._.
__label__1 needz  moar!
__label__1 trust  should  only  be  given  to  those  who  truly  understand  its  value.
__label__1 let's  see...  we've  had  typhoons  in  pacific  asia,  and  now  heavy  flooding  in  the  uk,  bushfires  in  australia,  landslides  in  turkey,  volcano  eruption  in  colombia,  new  mutation  of  hn  that's  resistant  to  tamiflu,  and  a  whole  lot  of  violent  human  related  killings,  while  here  in  singapore  we  complain  about  water  reaching  our  ankles...  wtf?!
__label__1 when  you  start  debating  to  yourself  on  the  mechanisms  of  magic,  you  also  subconciously  debate  as  to  the  strength  of  your  hold  on  reality.  conclusion:  fantasy  is  addictive.  o,o
__label__1 no  sense  makes  nonsense,  but  nonsense  makes  sense.  so  what  then  is  nonsense,  in  a  world  without  sense?  o.o
__label__1 it's  amazing  how  easily  you  can  find  aunties  that  speak  both  malay  &  chinese  but  not  english...
__label__1 me,  myself,  and  my  computer.  deja  vu
__label__1 had  a  -  has  a  fever.  got  stuck  in  a  jam  at  orchard  road.  after  the  jam,  bus  broke  down.  while  waiting  at  a  new  bus  stop,  two  busses  drove  by  without  stopping.  ended  up  taking  four  hours  to  get  home.  god  is  evil.
__label__1 is  finally  on  a  role  playing  world  of  warcraft  server!  all  aboard  the  fantasy  train!  >=d
__label__1 no  more  tv  mobile  next  year...  i  am  sad...  d:
__label__1 "but  i  don't  want  to  go  among  mad  people,"  alice  remarked.  "oh,  you  can't  help  that,"  said  the  cat:  "we're  all  mad  here.  i'm  mad.  you're  mad."  "how  do  you  know  i'm  mad?"  said  alice.  "you  must  be,"  said  the  cat,  "or  you  wouldn't  have  come  here."
__label__1 women  speak  because  they  wish  to  speak,  whereas  a  man  speaks  only  when  driven  to  speech  by  something  outside  himself  --  like,  for  instance,  when  he  can't  find  any  clean  socks...
__label__1 watched  inglorius  basterds  on  blu-ray  followed  by  avatar  in  d  and  is  feeling  soooo  epic.  dayum.

__label__1 is  cutting  his  hair  bald  -
__label__1 a  break  from  the  norm  in  the  wake  of  this  storm  is  the  strange  sound  of  silence  as  i  wait  to  be  born
__label__1 well,  according  to  my  parents,  when  i  was  like  ,  everytime  my  sister  tried  to  call  me  'abang',  i'd  shout  at  her  and  say,  "brother!!  not  abang!!"  at  least  now  i  know  why  i  never  got  anywhere  with  malay  >.>

__label__1 "oh  my  god  dude,  doing    tomorrow  is  going  to  feel  like  sex!"  --*propname*
__label__1 asleep  with  open  eyes.
__label__1 the  love  of  my  life:  repeat  s  on  a  sunny  day.
__label__1 "do  not  dwell  in  the  past,  do  not  dream  of  the  future,  concentrate  the  mind  on  the  present  moment."  --buddha
__label__1 driving  to  nowhere.  accompanied  only  by  the  pitter-patters  of  rain  on  my  windshield.
__label__1 "we  americans  think  you  have  to  accomplish  everything  quickly.  we're  the  country  of  thirty-minute  lunches  and  two-minute  football  drill...[we  need  to]  slow  down  and  make  building  relationships  as  important  as  building  projects."    --*propname*

__label__1 so,  just  about  everyone  on  my  friend  list  is  highly  upset  that  it's  monday;  but  i  know  that  once  i  get  through  this  "-  in  class  +  homework  after  that"    monday,  my  week  is  nearly  over...  plus  home  on  thursday  for  fall  break!!!!    it's  going  to  be  a  great  week,  i  can  just  feel  it!
__label__1 was  astoundingly  productive  today...  chipping  away  is  a  lot  better  method  than  sitting  around  trying  to  figure  out  how  to  tackle  the  whole  mountain!
__label__1 life  is  way  too  short  and  way  too  good  to  stress  out  or  worry...  :)
__label__1 memo  is  over---  going  to  get  something  done  to  my  hair,  then  cleaning  the  apartment  and  going  out  with  *propname*  for  a  little  early  birthday  celebration!
__label__1 so  as  i  was  driving  to  school  this  morning,  belting  "my  baby  loves  me  just  the  way  that  i  am"  into  my  coffee  mug...  i  realized  for  the  th  time  this  week  just  how  much  i  love  life...    can't  wait  to  go  home  tomorrow  and  spend  lots  of  time  this  week  with  my  *propname*  and  my  family!
__label__1 c-span  is  unbelievable...  the  house  is  a  zoo  this  morning....    rep.  dingell  is  being  a  very  unfair  kindergarten  teacher  over  an  unruly  class...
__label__1 tuesday  is  here!!  home  after  my  property  class...  happy  birthday  to  my  meme  myrtle  (my  grandma)  who  is    years  old  today!!!  :)    she's  the  best  and  i'm  so  lucky  she's  my  grandma!
__label__1 cleaning  the  apartment...
__label__1 *propname*  and  *propname*'s  wedding  went  great!  i'm  so  happy  for  them!!!      wish  i  had  my  sd  card  earlier  so  i  could  have  taken  more  pics...    now,  in  richmond  and  back  to  the  real  world...  missin'  my  darlin'...
__label__1 ohh,  cleaning  then  reading  for  school...  all  the  while  just  thinking  about  how  much  i  can't  wait  to  go  home  on  thursday!    lots  of  time  with  my  one  and  only,  hunting,  and  all  the  fun  and  good  people  that  go  along  with  both!    can  not  wait.
__label__1 had  enough  of  this  memo  today,  almost  done!  reading  a  good  book  until  sleep...  can't  wait  until  home  on  tuesday...  it's  going  to  be  a  great  week!
__label__1 coffee,  christmas  cookies,  civil  procedure  and  christmas  movies...  :)
__label__1 back  in  richmond  after  a  great  thanksgiving  break...  missing  my  darlin'  already...    can't  wait  to  get  through  these  next    weeks  and  have  my  first  semester  of  law  school  behind  me...  :)
__label__1 so  good  to  be  home!    planning  to  get  a  few  things  accomplished  today  and  then  going  to  see  my  love  after  he  gets  off  work!
__label__1 back  in  richmond,  reading  for  classes  tomorrow  and  getting  ready  for  the  week..  can't  believe  i  only  have    full  weeks  of  classes  left  of  the  semester....
__label__1 oh  future  interests....  you  defeat  me.    professor  berryhill,  i  admit  that  you  are  god,  please  have  mercy  on  my  poor,  ignorant,  l  soul...
__label__1 is  wondering  why  her  attention  span  is  so  pitiful...  must...  pay...  attention...
__label__1 has  had  a  great  week  with  my  darlin'....  :)    it's  gone  by  way  too  fast...  now,  hunting  with  daddy  till  *propname*  gets  off  at  :...
__label__1 civ  pro  outlining  and  watching  the  pelican  brief...  and  before  you  think  "she  shouldn't  be  watching  a  movie"....  it's  a  movie  about  the  law  and  a  law  student,  it  definitely  qualifies  as  studying  in  my  book....  :)
__label__1 in  the  final    week  stretch!!
__label__1 snowing  in  richmond...
__label__1 so  i  really  have  a  final  tomorrow...  i  think  that's  finally  starting  to  set  in.
__label__1 studying  torts----missing  *propname*...
__label__1 property  midterm  =  over,    life  =  good,    me  =  packing  up,  dentists  appt.,  home.
__label__1 *propname*  and  i  have  successfully  added  a  new  trick  to  our  list...  playing  dead!    we're  excited!    :)    and  we  can't  wait  to  show  it  off  to  *propname*  when  he  gets  here!  <
__label__1 fried  taters  for  supper...  :)
__label__1 law  school...  you  are  not  too  much  fun  today...  december  th,  please  come  soon...
__label__1 *propname*  and  i  went  to  blockbuster  to  get  a  couple  movies...  we  both  said  we'd  been  wanting  to  see  four  christmases,  so  we  got  it...  turns  out  we  watched  it  together  last  year.  haha...    a  tradition  in  the  making?    teriyaki  pork  sirloin  and  stir  fry  for  dinner...  love  having  him  here  <
__label__1 so  *propname*  just  ate  the  end  of  my  highlighter...  i  think  that  means  she  wants  me  to  stop  studying...
__label__1 went  to  eat  some  mexican  food,  now  fixing  some  homemade  hot  cocoa  and  watching  movies  with  *propname*...  <
__label__1 so  i  decided  that  personally  thanking  everyone  for  the  birthday  wishes  was  probably  blowing  up  too  many  people's  news  feeds...  so  thanks  to  everyone!    <<<
__label__1 r.i.p.  orange  highlighter....  that  makes  the  score:  highlighters-;  *propname*-
__label__1 memo-writing...

__label__1 dear  god,  i  know  you've  got  a  lot  going  on  with  jesus'  birthday  coming  up  and  all,  but  i  need  you  to  take  this  civil  procedure  exam  for  me  in  the  morning.    i  know  you  take  all  of  my  exams  for  me,  but  i  really  need  ya  in  an  extra  special  sort  of  way  for  this  one.  oh  and    one  more  thing,  please  hold  off  the  snow  until  i  can  make  it  home....
__label__1 okay  so  why  am  i  here  going  through  a  long  day  of  classes  and  feeling  stressed  and  overwhelmed  instead  of  at  home  happily  hunting  with  my  love???    oh  yea,  i  want  to  finish  law  school  and  be  a  lawyer...  i  want  to  finish  law  school  and  be  a  lawyer...  just  have  to  keep  telling  myself  that.    haha.

__label__0 i  need  a  job
__label__0 is  checking  her  facebook  a  little  more  than  she  used  to...but  facebook  still  bombards  her  with  more  information  than  she  has  time  to  fool  with!    taking  things  at  a  glance.
__label__0 is  sick  as  a  dog  &  about  to  go  home  early...bluhhhh
__label__0 is  sick  of  the  pain.
__label__0 ...
__label__0 i  will  be  fine.    i've  gotten  through  everything  that  has  ever  been  thrown  at  me--nothing  can  keep  me  down  for  long.
__label__0 will  probably  be  taking  a  hiatus  from  facebook  again  for  a  bit...you  know  where  to  reach  me  if  you  wish  to  do  so!
__label__0 has  a  tummyache  (again,  stupid  tummy)  but  is  otherwise  alright!
__label__0 isn't  gonna  fool  with  facebook  applications,  but  does  check  facebook  briefly  every  day  now,  for  what  it's  worth...
__label__0 ...my  heart  hurts.
__label__0 is  somewhat  on  hiatus  from  facebook  for  a  while...may  check  it  occasionally...*shrug*
__label__0 is  very  well-rested,  lol.
__label__0 is  doin'  alright.  something  i've  come  to  realize:  you  can't  depend  on  anyone  all  the  time...but  almost  all  the  time  is  a  damn  good  percentage!
__label__0 is  so  glad  i  finally  tried  a  chiropractor!    my  back  hasn't  felt  this  good  in  ages!    i  was  very  crackly,  lol.
__label__0 is  still  pretty  much  on  facebook  hiatus...if  you  message  me  i'll  probably  answer  though.  otherwise,  most  of  you  know  where  to  find  me!
__label__0 is  relaxing...
__label__0 feeling  pretty  good  since  the  whole  'tweaking  my  outlook'  kick  i've  been  on...except  for  this  sore  throat//sniffles  thing,  geh.  but  i'll  live...hey,  drinking  tea  goes  along  with  the  zen  thing  anyway,  lol.
__label__0 is  determined  to  be  strong.
__label__0 feels  kinda  better  after  going  home  early  yesterday  &  resting...-hour  bug?    whatever  it  was  i'ma  try  to  take  it  easy  today  too.
__label__0 gonna  stay  late  at  work  to  get  some  extra  stuff  done,  &  then  go  home  &  veg  out.  i'm  a  geezer  today,  i  guess...
__label__0 i  mean  to  go  to  bed  early  (to  get  over  the  plague  of  atlanta),  and  yet  i  end  up  staying  up  all  night  doing  practically  nothing.    story  of  my  life.    hmph!
__label__0 bev  quote  of  the  hour:  "bah,  the  chaos  gods  can  suck  my  intangible  throbbing  member."
__label__0 doing  enough  work  to  compensate  for  being  in  atlanta  thursday  &  friday...blehhhh.    (still  at  work  at  frickin'  midnight!)    but  the  trip,  the  company  &  the  brief  respite  from  li  will  be  soooo  bloody  appreciated.
__label__0 am  engaged  in  battle  with  the  plague-beasts  of  atlanta.  *sneeze*    vitamins  make  good  ammo  in  such  altercations!
__label__0 yay  mythbusters!    ninjas,  explosions,  and  science,  oh  my!  :d  *nerdnerdnerd*
__label__0 this  morning  my  dad  said  "it  smells  weird  in  your  apartment."    found  the  culprit--something  in  my  dad's  house  upstairs  sprung  a  leak...right  through  my  bedroom  ceiling,  saturating  my  bedroom.    my  mattress,  lots  of  pillows,  some  expensive  clothes  and  some  beloved  posters  i  was  saving...are  all  ruined.    and  the  water's  still  leaking!    grrahhhh...
__label__0 musta  been,  i  dunno,  sleep-spelunking  or  somethin  last  night-cos  i  woke  up  with  a  fucked  up  knee.  i'ma  try  to  rest  this  wkend  &  rid  myself  of  the  mysterious  plague  of  atlanta  that  drained  me  all  week;  wish  there  was  a  cure  for  excessive  nihilism,  though.  *makes  face*
__label__0 ok...there  are  piles  of  "junk  that  isn't  supposed  to  be  on  my  desk"  that  keep  getting  bigger...while  the  things  that  are  supposed  to  live  on  my  desk  are  magically  disappearing.    what  fresh  hell  is  this?!
__label__0 the  mighty  boosh  is  completely  mad  but  completely  awesome.  it  has  soothed  my  disgruntled  sadness  with  its  peculiar  brand  of  british  inanity...and  interpretive  dance.  *nodnod*
__label__0 today's  sky  is  as  grey  as  my  default  mood  setting.    sometimes  it's  rather  exhausting  being  so  exquisitely  angst-ridden...*rolls  eyes,  sighs*
__label__0 gah...sick  of  feeling  like  crap!  gods  deliver  me  from  resilient  falltime  ailments...*brandishes  stick  menacingly...then  gets  dizzy  and  passes  out*
__label__0 "i  said  he's  a  fairy  i  do  suppose//flyin  thru  the  air  in  pantyhose//he  may  be  very  sexy  or  even  cute//but  he  looks  like  a  sucka  in  a  blue  and  red  suit//i  said  you  need  a  man  who's  got  finesse//&  his  whole  name  across  his  chest//he  may  be  able  to  fly  all  thru  the  night//but  can  he  rock  a  party  til  the  early  light//he  can't  satisfy  you  with  his  little  worm//but  i  can  bust  you  out  w  my  super  sperm!!"  rapper's  delight  on  superman
__label__0 feelin'  pretty  lousy  today...basically  zombie-ing  through  work,  and  not  in  the  fun  way.    i  feel  like  part  of  my  brain  is  missing  and  has  been  replaced  by  canned  air.    bleah...monday  is  definitely  my  least  favorite  day!
__label__0 i  know  it's  gonna  be  a  'pajama  weekend'  when  i  find  myself  doing  my  weekend  grocery  shopping  at  the  -  at  :  a.m...
__label__0 oy,  jiminator--this  bring  back  any  college  memories,  lol?  "i  got  blood  on  my  hands  and  there's  no  remorse;  i  got  blood  on  my  dick  cause  i  fucked  a  corpse..."  when  i  hear  it  i  think  of  you,  haha!  :d
__label__0 faring  alright,  i  s'pose...just  sore,  and  scouring  the  universe  for  used  toyotas  &  hondas...    need  transportation,  stat!    anyone  with  input  on  the  car  front,  please  comment!    hope  everyone's  halloween  rocked...
__label__0 "got  an  animated  corpse//at  my  beck  &  call//you  will  find  my  skin  cells  underneath  his  fingernails//carpet  fibers  from  my  car//covering  his  coat  and  clinging  to  his  follicles//everyday  we  meet//plot  fourteen//as  he  hops  in  the  front  in  the  seat  next  to  me//he  can't  wait  til  i  tell  him  what  i  need//then  he  nods  a  rotting  head  and  then  i  set  him  free"
__label__0 wtf...did  i  like,  get  mono  or  something  in  atlanta  (and  how  would  i  get  mono  there?  i  don't  make  out  with  my  relatives,  ew!)?    i've  felt  consistently  crappy  and  out  of  it  ever  since  i  came  back.    meh.    in  other  news,  thanks  to  lorna,  i  have  "unpack  your  adjectives"  stuck  in  my  head,  lol...
__label__0 errghhh...insomnia  suuuuucks!  *whines,  ears  begin  to  bleed*
__label__0   people  today  mentioned  that  my  wall  is  disabled  from  being  posted  on...i  didn't  even  know!  lol,  changed  it...post  at  will  i  guess.  *shrug!*  in  other  news...yay  cartoons!  "yeees,  we  have  no//  bananas//  todaaaaayyy!"
__label__0 gah,  bus  schedules  are  confusing!  *scratches  head,  which  then  explodes*

__label__0 might  have  contracted  the  rockin'  pneumonia...but  i  hope  i  don't  get  the  boogie-woogie  flu--it  sounds  repulsive!    by  the  way,  i  hate  that  song.  (no,  i'm  not  sick...i'm  just  a  weirdo!)
__label__0 almost  forgot  it  was  sunday  night...yay  for  new  venture  bros.  eps!    (my  preciousssss...)    but  dude,  who  saw  the  metalocalypse  season  premiere?    when  that  "surprise  thing"  happened  i  literally  screamed  in  joy  (woke  up  my  dad,  lol)!    maybe  semi-expected  but  still,  woot!
__label__0 spacemen    are  pretty  good...but  in  moderation--too  many  songs  in  a  row  and  they'll  put  you  to  sleep!  zzzzz...
__label__0 "woo-hah!  woo-hah!  got  you  all  in  check!"  lol
__label__0 checking  out  a  car  in  the  morning...hope  it  checks  out--i'm  not  enjoying  this  carless  whatnottery!
__label__0 god  damn  it...i  need  for  my  laptop  to  not  freeze  for    minutes  before  deciding  to  perhaps  or  perhaps  not  perform  the  command  i've  clicked...i  need  a  car  that  isn't  a  fucking  pretzel,  or  at  least  some  form  of  viable  transportation...i  need  add  meds  that  don't  leave  me  staring  off  into  fucking  space  at  work...gahhh!    very  fucking  frustrated!    anyone  with  input  re  laptop  or  car,  please  comment...*sigh*
__label__0 it's  insane  how  much  time  one  has  to  spend  on  the  telephone  with  basically  everyone  in  christendom  after  a  big  car  accident...blahhhh...deliver  me  from  being  on  hold  all  day!  *glares  at  phone*
__label__0 meh.    humans  are  a  fickle  species.
__label__0 about  to  go  to  bed  so  i  can  get  up  early  to  check  out  a  car  tomorrow  morn...*crosses  fingers*  hope  this  one  pans  out;  the  longer  i'm  trapped,  vehicleless,  the  more  likely  i  am  to  go  completely  bloody  mad!
__label__0 it's  a  dk  kind  of  day.  *nod*
__label__0 "*propname*  could  never  have  superman's  baby.  do  you  think  her  fallopian  tubes  could  handle  the  sperm?  i  guarantee  he  blows  a  load  like  a  shotgun  right  through  her  back...the  only  way  he  could  bang  regular  chicks  is  with  a  kryptonite  condom...but  that  would  kill  him!"
__label__0 unproductive  day...home  sick  &  made  no  money,  and  no  progress  carwise...but  at  least  i  got  some  rest,  i  guess.  *sigh*
__label__0 went  and  got  the  last  of  my  stuff  out  of  my...car...(read:  twisted  metal  heap  with  fuzzy  seats)  this  morning.    it  was  kind  of  sad...i  apologized  to  car  (yeah,  that's  its  name  dammit,  shut  up)  for  smushing  it,  and  hugged  it  goodbye,  and  then  took  the  title  to  my  mechanic  so  it  can  be  junked.    thusly,  the  day  started  in  kind  of  a  somber  mood.    if  only  i  could  locate  a  sufficient  replacement,  though...
__label__0 well,  going  to  bed  with  a  smile  on  my  face.    nice  change  from  the  rest  of  the  week!  haha...somehow  my  facebook  got  switched  to  german  for  awhile...it  was  ok,  'cause  i  could  read  most  of  the  german--just  rather  random!    this  box  asked  me  "was  machts  du  gerade"  for  half  the  night...lol.    actually  i  might  switch  it  back  to  german  and  leave  it  for  awhile--it  amuses  me!  :p
__label__0 soooo  frickin'  psyched  for  atlanta.    getting  the  fuck  outta  li,  seeing  my  superawesome  folks,  finally  getting  some  proper  southern  food,  and  maybe  even  checking  out  decatur  nightlife  &  williams  street...the  word  of  the  day  is  "yaaayyyyy!"

__label__0 bah!  humbug!  in  other  news,  i  really  wanna  see  ninja  assassin!  in  other  news...eh,  don't  matter  anyway,  nevermind.
__label__0 car  search  =driving  me  mad!  no  jetpacks  on  ebay  (i  checked)  so  that's  out.  rollerblading'd  surely  break  my  ass.  motorcycle=me  smeared  across  the  pavement.  mopeds  are...small.  no  horse  handy  or  i  could  amish  it  up  w//  a  little  cart!  bikeseats  hurt  my  delicate  posterior.  boats  don't  travel  well  on  land.  don't  think  segways  go  fast  enough  to  get  anywhere-i'd  probably  fall  off  anyway.  hurry  up  &  invent  transporters!!
__label__0 having  a  mixed  day:  got  less  than    hour  of  sleep  (and  even  that  was  interrupted  sleep!),  so  i'm  kinda  white-knuckling  it  through  the  workday  a  bit...but  also  got  the  car  'legal'  at  the  dmv--and  it  only  took  like    minutes!    well,  at  least  i'm  too  tired  to  think  myself  into  a  funk  again!
__label__0 i  just  saw  an...interesting...car  commercial.  according  to  said  commercial,  apparently  "twilight's  *propname*"  drives...a  volvo.  a  volvo.  a  vampire...in  a  volvo.*  wow...i  didn't  think  that  that  character  could  get  any  lamer;  i  was  wrong!    *no  offense  to  volvo  owners,  the  cars  are  fine...but  'mister  (supposedly)  superawesome  vampire'  driving  one?  lol.
__label__0 is  now  friends  with  i  need  a  fucking  car!!!
__label__0 i  gotta  ask:  why  pirates  or  ninjas?    why  not  both?    also,  two  interesting  concepts  i've  recently  discovered:  horror  cakes  competition  on  food  network  tomorrow  (one  of  them  bleeds  when  you  cut  the  cake!  awesome!)...and  a  children's  book  series  i  saw  in  the  bookstore  recently,  called  vampirates...i  dig  the  name,  and  the  concept...not  sure  about  the  execution  though.    still...intriguing!
__label__0 feeling  quite  content,  in  spite  of  all  that  'ails'  me.  *quirks  lips  into  a  serene  smile*
__label__0 "hope  in  reality  is  the  worst  of  all  evils  because  it  prolongs  the  torment  of  man."--friedrich  nietzsche  ----------------------------------------  yeah,  fuck  hope.    let's  try  action!    control  what  you  can  control.    determination  burns  within  me  again.
__label__0 tired  of  introspection  tonight;  it  leaves  me...bereft...and  the  silence  screams  madly  in  my  ears.
__label__0 finally  got  a  car!    nissan  altima  gxe  w//  ,  miles  on  it  in  pretty  good  shape.  mechanics  aside,  glad  i  have  a  car  w//  a  stereo  again.  don't  like  that  it's  white,  but  i  took  what  i  could  get!  might  either  mural-paint  or  shop-repaint  it  if  it  annoys  me  enough.    also  had  a  really  great  weekend  (thank  you,  guys.  xoxo!)--nice  change  from  the  last  few!  glad  as  hell  i'm  not  stranded  anymore!!
__label__0 is  freezing!    not  feeling  very  good,  either.    hope  it's  a  'passing  fancy'  and  not  an  ailment!
__label__0 happy  halloween  all!  stuck  @  home  recuperating  from  totaling  my  fuckin  car  yestermorn-they're  right,  it  does  hurt  more  the  day  after-but  "i'm  not  dead  yet!!"  great  time  last  night  tho-celebrating  living.  thanx  to  all  who  made  it  possible  &  who  made  it  awesome!  yay  dethklok  show,  asylum,  &  some  fucking  wonderful  humans,  including  my  rockin'  friends  &  lotsa  cool  folks  i  met  last  night.  *hugs  the  world,  retreats  to  bed*
__label__0 i'm  back  from  atlanta,  over    hours  after  i  was  s'posed  to  be...am  worn  the  fuck  out.    but  had  a  great  fuckin'  time  down  there  before  the  airtravel  assraping!    so,  yay  to  that!  ;d

__label__0 waking  from  a  really  good  dream  into  harsh  reality  is  one  of  the  great  cruelties  of  life.    *groggy  and  disgruntled*
__label__0 ...and  now  back  to  my  regularly  scheduled  severe  dangerously-nihilistic  depression.  :d!!!!!!!!!!!one!
__label__0 bored  with  cartoons  &  porn...time  to  sleep  i  guess.  *blink,  shrug,  yawn*
__label__0 it  just  occurred  to  me  that  two  of  my  favorite  songs  are  punk  songs  about  gruesome  abortions  ("bodies"  by  sex  pistols  and  "die  of  shame"  by  tilt)...man,  i'm  just  not  quite  right,  lol!
__label__0 "just  another  manic  monday"...nah,  not  really--if  i  was  manic  right  now  i'd  probably  be  getting  alot  more  done,  lol!
__label__0 intelligence  is  a  curse,  life  a  senseless  disease.    gods  grant  me  respite  by  death  or  lobotomy...
__label__0 my,  how  the  randomness  abounds!...but  i  need  some  sleep.
__label__0 heh...:"god  i  wish  that  i  could  hide  away//and  find  a  wall  to  bang  my  brains//i'm  living  in  a  fantasy,//a  nightmare  dream...reality//people  ride  about  all  day//in  metal  boxes  made  away//i  wish  that  they  would  drop  the  bomb//and  kill  these  cunts//that  don't  belong!  i  hate  people!//i  hate  the  human  race//i  hate  people!//i  hate  your  ugly  face//i  hate  people!//i  hate  your  fucking  mess//i  hate  people!//they  hate  me!"-anti-nowhere  league
__label__0 my  foot  is  asleep...maybe  it's  trying  to  tell  me  i  should  be  asleep,  too...*conks*
__label__0 today's  stream  of  consciousness:  hooray  for  comic  books,  poetry  and  nerds  in  general...forgot  my  phone  at  home  today,  blargh  (couldn't  reach  me,  that's  why)...swamped  at  work...pretzels  suck...missing  nola  (especially  the  quarter)  alot  today  for  some  reason..."the  holidays"  are  annoying  me  already...wikipedia  is  addictive...so  is  facebook,  gods  help  me...!
__label__0 holy  shit,  the  sky  is  falling:  my  dad  actually  cheered  me  up  out  of  a  tough  spot  for  once!    maybe  he's  learning!    or  maybe  it  was  a  fluke...either  way,  i  feel  a  lot  better  now!    :)    dammit  someone  find  me  a  good  yoga  studio  now,  lol!
__label__0 meh.  bleh.  feh!!
__label__0 my  body  may  be  a  medical  nightmare,  but  at  least  it  leaves  me  hangover-free  for  some  reason,  hah!    glad  to  see  everyone  last  night...thanks  all  for  the  *loves*  and  for  those  who  were  kind  in  the  face  of  my  drunken  overhonesty,  oy.
__label__0 never  enough
__label__0 needs  a  change.  anyone  know  any  yoga  studios  in  or  close  to  the  smithtown//kings  park  area?  gotta  find  my  zen  again!
__label__0 sunday  bloody  sunday...booooring...!
__label__0 just  had  a  -minute  conversation  w//  my  dad  about  midget  porn.    sometimes  he  ain't  half  bad,  lol...
__label__0 it's  amazing  what  you'll  watch  on  tv  when  you  stay  up  all  night.
__label__0 "yes  yes  yes,  effervescently  meaningless..."
__label__0 getting  another  potential  car  checked  out  by  my  mechanic  tomorrow...god  i  hope  one  of  these  fucking  things  works  out  soon!  *blows  up  apartment*
__label__0 what's  black  and  green  and  red  all  over?    me  after  the  gwar  show,  yeah!  xd    time  for  the  sleep  of  a  lifetime  now,  though...damn.
__label__0 getting  out  of  the  house,  yay!    going  with  'anon'  (lol)  to  eat  curry  and  hang  out  with  folks  or  someodd.    man,  anywhere's  better  than  being  stuck  at  my  stupid  apartment!
__label__0 sick  of  this  nihilistic  depression  shit--fine,  life  may  be  meaningless,  i  may  be  right  about  all  the  other  disturbingly  bleak  shit  i've  been  thinking...but  i'm  not  a  self-killer  so  i'm  stuck  here--might  as  well  pull  it  together  and  live  this  crazy  life  i've  got  anyway,  eh?    some  change  is  in  the  works  (just  in  time  for  the  new  year,  ironically).
__label__0 yes,  i  have  no  bananas...i  have  no  bananas  todayyyyy!
__label__0 going  upstairs  to  beg  my  dad  for  some  of  the  wonderful-smelling  eggplant  parm  they  just  made!  *crosses  fingers*  no  food  down  here.  :(
__label__0 me  da  is  my  hero  right  now...he  found  me  some  fucking  nyquil!!      hours  awake  is  waaaay  more  than  enough  (especially  when  i'm  sick).    going  to  go  smoke  with  the  ghost  in  the  back  of  my  head  (heyy,  random  little-remembered  song  reference!).    goodnight  folks!!
__label__0 went  to  the  latest  disney  cartoon  with  my  dad  tonight...it  was  set  in  new  orleans  and  it  was  surprisingly  pretty  good.  but  it  made  me  miss  my  nola  soo  much...as  i  told  my  dad,  i'm  sure  i'll  end  up  back  home  someday,  but  for  now  i  need  to  be  here.  sigh!      in  other  news,  my  cold  is  getting  worse,  blech.  trying  everything  i  can  to  get  rid  of  it  quickly!
__label__0 i  gotta  admit...powerpuff  girls  cracks  me  up!  :p    yeah,  shush.  in  other  news...fuck  i'm  freezin'  me  arse  off!
__label__0 if  i'm  stuck  in  the  house  long  enough,  maybe  i'll  clean  it!    that's  looking  on  the  bright  side  i  guess...at  least  i'm  in  a  better  mood  and  a  little  less  ill  than  yesterday,  though  maybe  a  little  stir  crazy--i  found  myself  dancing  to  the  baskin  *propname*  'ice  cream  and  cake'  commercial,  lol!
__label__0 ugh...headache  and  some  amount  of  nervousness.    resurrection  tomorrow  night  though,  yay!    night  all...
__label__0 holy  sinus  headache,  batman!  *left  eyeball,  unable  to  take  the  'pressure,'  explodes  out  of  skull,  shoots  across  room,  lands  in  file  drawer  under  "o"  for  "owwww"*
__label__0 tis  the  season  to  cough  up  weird  stuff...yecch.
__label__0 can't  sleep--landmines  in  my  mind.    awake  since    am,  ugh...
__label__0 happy  thingy,  people...
__label__0 ok...broken  snow  shovel,  and  the  plow  bastard  we  called  is    hours  late.    don't  mind  too  much  that  i'm  missing  work,  but  i  do  mind  that  i  have  no  food  in  the  house  and  wanted  to  go  buy  some  fucking  food!    that  plow  motherfucker  will  be  getting  my  spaceboot  up  his  plowtastic  ass!    as  long  as  i  don't  pass  out  from  starvation  first,  hmph.
__label__0 had  bad  dreams  last  night,  some  sobering  thoughts  on  my  mind...yet  i'm  still  in  a  good  mood  today.    i  don't  get  it,  but  i'm  not  complaining!
__label__0 sad  &  depressed  as  hell,  but  rocking  the  living  fuck  out...weird  combination.
__label__0 supposedly  hauppauge  means  "land  of  sweet  water."    somehow  i  doubt  the  water's  very  "sweet"  anymore,  considering  that  hauppauge  is  now  an  industrial  district...
__label__0 dear  santa:    i  know  i'm  a  grinch,  but  could  you  please  bring  me  a  computer  repairman  for  christmas?    i'll  make  you  jambalaya...
__label__0 "and  life  is  thorny,  and  youth  is  vain;  and  to  be  wroth  with  ones  we  love  doth  work  like  madness  in  the  brain."--samuel  taylor  coleridge
__label__0 my  car  no  longer  screeches  like  a  banshee  passing  kidney  stones...thanks,  mr.  mechanic!    in  other  news,  my  'simple'  cold  is  worsening  by  the  hour  and  i'm  feverish...and  all  of  the  home  remedies  and  cold  meds  i  try  are  for  naught!    bah!
__label__0 well  that  was  entertaining...got  some  of  my  dad's  eggplant  parm,  but  was  treated  to  watching  him,  completely  sloshed,  watch  the  wizard  of  oz  and  caterwaul  all  the  words  with  both  *propname*  and  the  wicked  witch.  he  says  the  wizard  is  a  prick,  by  the  way.    and,  "look!  look,  bev,  they  dropped  a  fuckin'  house  on  her!!"
__label__0 sorry  i  had  to  bail  so  early  on  sanctuary  last  night,  folks...sick  &  tired  does  not  a  fun  bev  make--sittin'  in  the  corner  like  ol'  granny  watchin'  the  kiddies  play  outside!  *scrunches  nose*
__label__0 i'm  so  pleased  today  i  might  start  glowing!  xd  ...hopefully  more  in  a  pleasant  way  than  a  radioactive  way.    a  new  year  is  directly  impending,  yay!!    ecstatic  for  a  symbolic  fresh  start//  season  of  change,  let  me  tell  you!
__label__0 momentarily  considered  waxing  poetic  about  the  new  year  (one  'holiday'  that  is  actually  somewhat  important  to  me),  but  it's  all  been  said  before,  i'm  sure.    instead,  i'm  just  gonna  go  get  loads  of  sleep  so  i  can  enjoy  tomorrow  night's  festivities  wholeheartedly!
__label__0 second  half  of  last  week  quite  sucked  and  was  uneventful  to  boot...may  this  week  be  an  improvement!    *kicks  suckiness  repeatedly  with  pointy!pointy!shoes*
__label__0 dammit  dammit  i  can't  sleep!    awake  all  night  then  tried  to  fall  asleep  for    hours.    at  least  if  i  had  hypothermia  i'd  fall  unconscious...hmm.    but  that  would  require  going  outside...or,  more  importantly,  moving.    fuck  that  noise!
__label__0 hoping  this  insane  wind  doesn't  blow  me  away  to  oz...those  munchkins  might've  gone  feral  by  now.  *shudder*
__label__0 i  lahk  the  cut  o'  yerr  jib...*licks  teeth  creepily*
__label__0 well...if  my  interactions  and  happenings  of  last  night  were  any  indication,    may  well  be  a  pretty  good  year...but  we'll  see!    happy  new  year,  love  y'all!  :d
__label__0 is  currently  being  a  disgruntled  employee...grrr.  *brandishes  fist  ineffectually*
__label__0 eh,  why  the  hell  not:    this  should  be  interesting.  lets  see  how  honest  my  fb  friends  are.  leave  a    word  comment  that  you  think  best  describes  me.  it  can  only  be    word.  no  more  than    word.  then  copy  &  paste  this  post  on  your  wall  so  i  can  leave  a  word  about  you.  wonder  how  many  brave  friends  will  do  this.
__label__0 busybusybusy!  :d  out  &  about  is  much  better  than  in  and  bored!
__label__0 -wise,  so  far,  so  good!    feeling  pretty  bloody  fantastic  compared  to  my  emotional  state  of  the  last  few  months.    i've  even  been  somewhat  productive  recently.    however,  i  am  going  home  now;  my  desk  chair  has  made  my  ass  numb!    (how  does  one  wake  up  a  sleeping  ass,  haha?    i'll  probably  be  sorry  i  asked...)
__label__0 sick  as  a  dog  and  hoping  it  doesn't  snow  too  much.
__label__0 my  mind  feels  like  a  murder-suicide.    i  hate  this  life  so  much  it  hurts...and  it  hurts  so  much  i've  been  rendered  numb.
__label__0 re-conditioning  my  hands  back  into  top  gaming  form--i  used  to  be  able  to  go  all  day  (or  for  days)  without  a  break  (even  to  eat  or  go  to  the  bathroom,  lol...toldja  i  was  obsessed!);  currently  my  thumbs  start  to  hurt  after  about    hours.    that's  what  i  get  for  being  outta  practice,  bah!
__label__0 *sneeze,  cough,  snort*  blech!    trying  that  airborne  shit  tonight!    at  least  i'm  getting  the  screechy  car  fixed  today.    now  if  i  could  only  find  gloves  that  match  eachother...*wearing  one  black  leather  glove  and  one  knit  blue  striped  glove*
__label__0 "is  it  special  when  you're  lonely//  do  you  spend  your  whole  life//  in  a  studio  apartment//  with  a  cat  for  a  wife//  the  seasons,  when  they  call  you//  do  you  barricade  the  door//  are  you  stubborn,  stubborn,  stubborn  to  the  core?...then  the  longest  winter//  is  on  her  way//  you  called  her  without  knowing  it//  but  now  it's  too  late..."  trying  to  keep  the  zen,  but  it's  hard  to  hang  onto  sometimes  on  nights  like  these.
__label__0 cold  weather  can  bite  me,  and  so  can  christmas.    *sticks  out  tongue*    i'm  doin'  reasonably  alright  today  but  ehhhhh...got  a  'eadache  from  'ell.
__label__0 *sigh*
__label__0 oi!!!
__label__0 feeling  damn  good  headwise  lately:  forceful  self-change  of  outlook,  meds  seem  to  be  finally  working,  &  i'm  startin  to  get  shit  done!  'course,  meds  need  tweaking--one  of  'em  (dunno  which)  is  also  tryin  to  make  me  a  zombie--not  the  fun  movie  kind,  either:  i  get  sleepy  around    or    pm  now;  too  damn  early  even  if  i  weren't  a  night  owl!  psyched  bout  the  forward  progress,  but  this  zombie  thing's  crampin'  my  nightlife,  oy!
__label__0 sick  as  a  dog  and  wishing  my  heat  worked  better.  hoping  for  as  little  snow  as  possible,  under  these  circumstances!
__label__0 hates  crying,  hates  her  health  (or  lack  thereof),  hates  snow,  and  hates  christmas  and  its  trappings  of  tomfoolery.    today  has  become  a  day  of  hate.  *angry  pout*
__label__0 *rootin'  around  for  'retro'  bev  pics*
__label__0 meow  meow  tiiiiiredddd  meow  meow.  *pokes  work  with  stick*
__label__0 hopin'  i'll  sleep  tonight!  went  from  one  extreme  to  the  other--sleeping  all  the  time  to  not  sleeping  at  all.  what  an  unpleasant  adventure  this  is  being!
__label__0 surreal  night...i  think  i  might've  slept  and  just  woke  up  every  hour  and  lay  awake  for  awhile  before  falling  back  asleep  again--but  conversely,  i  might've  just  lain  awake  and  semi-insensible  the  whole  night  with  periods  of  more  awareness...not  sure  which!    either  way,  i'm  tired,  but  surprisingly  decent  otherwise!
__label__0 well,  lived  through  the  carbon  monoxide  shit,  though  it  made  me  sick  today--luckily  not  sick  enough  to  go  to  the  damn  hospital  i  guess;  just  sick  enough  to  be  puking  and  bedridden  today.  good  thing  i  had  the  day  off  anyway  for  mlk  day  (but  my  dad  didn't  tell  me  that,  so  i  woke  up  ill  and  panicky  this  afternoon--nice,  lol).  furnace  was  fixed  today,  though,  so  no  more  cm  troubles,  i  suppose!
__label__0 wheeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!!!    (she  says  as  she  continues  to  be  nerdy  on  her  couch.  :p)    veggin'  can  be  good  when  you're  having  sillyfuntime!  :d    ...takin'  a  vote  though:  after  cartoons,  shall  i  play  arcadey  fighters,  rpgs,  or  go  old-school?    narrowed  it  down  that  far,  but...so  hard  to  choose  hehe!
__label__0 have  good  weekend,  meine  leibschen,  yes  yes!    i  kiss  you,  muah!    (me,  hausfrau?!    nein,  nein!!!)
__label__0 ehh...bite  me!
__label__0 "some  of  the  shows  on  mtv  are  not  my  cup  of  tea...mainly  because  i  don't  like  huge  pieces  of  shit  in  my  tea!"
__label__0 doesn't  get  it--even  when  i  get  enough  sleep,  i  run  out  of  energy  long  before  the  day  is  over...what  gives?!    this  rampant  exhaustion  really  puts  a  cramp  on  my  life  &  times...and  now  i'm  gonna  go  sleep  some  more.    hmph!
__label__0 *sigh*
__label__0 i  try  to  keep  my  health  complaints  to  others  to  a  minimum  these  days,  but...well,  let's  just  say  fuck.    sometimes  i  feel  like  being  such  a  survivor  is  goddamned  overrated.
__label__0 sleepytime  at  last!    bundled  up  in  blankets  like  fuckin'  jesus  inna  manger.    or  medieval  couples  that  weren't  sposed  to  fuck  yet,  lol.    fuck  off,  snow!
__label__0 so  very  frustrated...&  kinda  sad.  and  so  fucking  sleepy...god  damn  these  meds,  i'm  sleeping  my  life  away.
__label__0 mehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhurrrrrghhhhhhhh.....
__label__0 is  ok  now.
__label__0 why  do  i  insist  on  eating  popsicles  in  winter?    om  nom  nom
__label__0 the  cleaner  my  apartment  gets,  the  more  of  my  hobbies  i  get  back  into  (partially  because  i  can  find  my  stuff  again,  lol!)...yayyy!    first  one  to  return:  gaming.    i  might  not  get  back  to  the  rest  of  those  erstwhile  hobbies  for  awhile,  though--i  tend  to  get  quiiite  obsessive  about  my  vidya  games,  hehe...
__label__0 it  liiiives!!!    (meds  adjusted--we'll  see  if  i  stay  awake  today!  *blinkblink*)
__label__0 *shrug*  eh.
__label__0 is  trying  not  to  be  grumpy.
__label__0 ok  lady  i  love  you  buh-bye!  *finally  leaves  house*
__label__0 off  to  prepare  for  a  night  of  festivitation...  here  we  come,  haharr!
__label__0 getting  ready  for  ma  belle  *propname*'s  birthday  whatnottery...may  i  not  fall  asleep  face-down  in  cake  this  evening!*crosses  fingers*
__label__0 hangin'  with  *propname*...stay  awake,  stay  awake!  *pokes  self  with  fork*
__label__0 dear  car  battery:  why  are  you  dead  again?    what  am  i  going  to  do  with  you??  (no,  really--what  am  i  supposed  to  do  with  it?)    you  make  me  sad.  ://
__label__0 hmm...it's  hard  to  play  'find  the  smell'  in  your  apartment  when  it's  so  cold  that  sniffing  the  air  hurts!    but  why  the  fuck  does  my  place  smell  like  a  lawnmower  anyway?!
__label__0 frisky  dingo  makes  my  chest  hurt...with  laughing!  i  need  to  get  season    stat.  damn,  i  would  pillage  for  some  bourbon  chicken  right  now!  glad  *propname*  is  finally  back  in  town...good  times  man!  :d
__label__0 taken  off  the  troublesome  med!  back  to  bev  as  usual  now  i  guess.
__label__0 brrr!    "stiff  little  fingers"  indeed!
__label__0 doesn't  know  what  to  think.
__label__0 upon  taking  a  brief  hiatus  from  facebook--holy  shit,  too  many  updates  to  read!  *mind  boggles*
__label__0 just  remembered  a  tv  ad  from  her  childhood  in  the  'glorious'  south:  horribly  fat,  hideous  angels  with  big  ol'  hair,  tammy-faye-esque  makeup,  and  (of  course)  heavy  southern  accents  hollering  "don't  you  buy  no  uug-ly  truuck!"  cracked  me  up  then,  cracks  me  up  now,  haha!
__label__0 meow?
__label__0 too  lazy  to  scan  'retro'  pics  right  now--fuck  it,  maybe  later.  i  notice  that  i  pretty  much  look  the  same  as  i  have  for  the  past  ~  years  (kinda  freaky!!)...thus,  it's  hard  to  tell  what  year  a  photo  is  from.  oddly  enough,  my  skin  was  better  when  i  was  a  teenager  than  it  is  now!
__label__0 black.
__label__0 well,  meds  situation  is  not  ideal  by  any  means  (zombieish  again)  but  it's  a  vast  improvement  on  the  last  few  days  of  horror!
__label__0 i  think  i've  finally  found  the  right  med...this  must  be  what  normal  people  feel  like!
__label__0 i  feel  pretty  spiffy  today--befuddling  my  dad  with  random  comments,  doin'  my  weird  acrobatics  and  dances,  singin'  wordless  nonsense  songs...alot  better  than  medicated  zombie  bev  (though  admittedly  alot  more  absurd,  lol)!    sure  spices  up  the  office  though  haha--as  long  as  i  don't  careen  into  the  conference  table!    :d
__label__0 fucking  carbon  monoxide  alarm's  going  off  repeatedly  again  tonight!  opened  the  windows  &  garage  doors;  i  have  nowhere  else  i  can  go  &  i  need  sleep,  so  i'm  gonna  hafta  just  hope  the  ventilation  is  enough  cos  i  don't  know  what  else  to  do.  hope  i  don't  end  up  in  the  hospital  over  this  shit--i'm  sick  of  the  damn  hospital!  (well...bein'  dead  would  [debatably]  suck  too.  but  i  wouldn't  be  self-aware  to  know  about  it,  lol.)
__label__0 has  been  too  busy  living  life  to  spend  much  time  on  facebook  this  week--just  the  way  i  like  it!  :d
__label__0 whew.
__label__0 got  to  be  'early  to  rise'  tomorrow,  so  i'ma  try  to  be  'early  to  bed'  tonight...thusly,  going  to  bed  now;  we'll  see  how  that  goes!
__label__0 is  amused  at  the  universe  today.  *cracks  up*
__label__0 hm...started  the  day  out  feeling  ok,  but  now  i  feel  like  three-week-old  leftovers  molding  in  the  back  of  a  broken  fridge  in  hell...yes,  a  hell-fridge.  guess  work  doesn't  agree  with  me!
__label__0 been  trying  to  catch  up  on  sleep  since  i  pretty  much  hadn't  slept  in    days...woken  up  by  the  carbon  monoxide  alarm,  and  it's  the  real  deal.    my  dad  opened  the  window  by  the  furnace  and  my  living  room  window  and  went  back  to  bed,  nice.    hmm...gonna  go  back  to  sleep  if  possible  and  hope  halfheartedly  that  i'm  still  alive  in  the  morning.
__label__1 made  it  safely  to  italy  :)    hour  trip  lol  havent  slept  one  sec  the  whole  time  will  upload  pics  of  my  trip  soon  and  through  out  the  month.
__label__1 i  just  saw  district  !  probably  one  of  the  best  sci-fi  movies  i  have  ever  seen.  i  recommend  anyone  that  likes  action  and  a  good  story  to  go  see  this  movie!
__label__1 on  my  way  to  get  my  license!  don't  have  a  car  yet  though...lol
__label__1 getting  my  license  finally!  lol...you  know  what  they  say...nd  time's  a  charm  :p
__label__1 leaving  for  italy  tomorrow  yay!!!!  i  will  be  back  on  august  th.  wont  be  able  to  text  till  then  lol  cya!

__label__1 found  red  bean  paste  in  her  chocolate  croissant  this  morning,  and  reluctantly  switched  her  inner  monologue  from  french  back  to  chinese.
__label__1 struggles  to  say  that  she's  taking  a  class  on  "networking"  with  a  straight  face.
__label__1 is  energized  by  super  last  minute  flights,  and  very  grateful  to  *propname*'s  mother.
__label__1 is  enchanted  by  this  website  (http:////www.inbflat.net//),  even  if  her  chinese  internet  can't  load  fast  enough  to  properly  display  the  videos.
__label__1 got  six  pairs  of  shoes  for  christmas.    it  might  officially  be  time  for  her  to  stop  wearing  her  much  loved  cirque  du  soleil  flip-flops.
__label__1 just  finished  a  christopher  lin-induced  snes  binge.    donkey  kong  country:  complete.    aladdin:  lamentably  ongoing.    there's  a  party  here  in  agrabah,  if  you  care  to  revitalize  her  arabian  efforts.
__label__1 this  week,  kelsey  gets  a  lita  star  for  her  authorship  of  "core  char,"  short  for  core  characters  of  a  show,  movie,  novel,  etc.,  etc.    thank  you  kelsey  for  your  contribution  to    "great  phrases  of  our  time."

__label__1 is  glad  that  he  caught  a  bit  of  "*propname*'s  drag  race"  last  night.    *propname*  stepped  it  up  a  notch  with  the  show  setting  and  hair//makeup.    the  competition  is  fiercer  than  ever...it  reminds  him  of  the  transition  "america's  next  top  model"  from  cycle    to  cycle  .    he's  feelin  "totes  reality"  right  now.

__label__0 is  sad  that  he  missed  out  on  fun  to  go  work  for  ~+  hours
__label__0 it  will  be  hot  for  the  next  few  days,  but  it  looks  like  we  should  be  getting  a  denser  cloud  of  percipitation  coming  over  san  diego  soon  which  should  help  cool  things  down  a  few  degrees.  but  don't  hold  me  to  it  i'm  not  an  actually  meterologist  so  my  interpertation  of  the  satalite  imagery  might  be  off  a  little.
__label__0 thinks  that  sleep  is  a  good  idea  and  who  ever  invented  sleep  deserves  a  cookie.  a  big  cookie.  with  chocolate  chips.  fresh  from  the  oven.  back  to  my  point,  sleep  =  good.
__label__0 first  day  of  school  =  tired  +  scared  for  when  real  work  comes.
__label__0 is  amazing  of  course,  and  the  apples  to  apples  champion.
__label__0 never  relized  how  tiring  it  is  to  be  social  for  exstended  periods  of  time.
__label__0 is  watching  reruns  of  house  on  hulu.  house  rocks,  and  when  he  comes  back  in  two  weeks  we  will  see  how  much  worse  the  crazy  people  are  when  house  goes  at  them.
__label__0 is  excited  that  he  was  able  to  perdict  the  weather  by  properly  interperting  satilite  imagery!!
__label__0 wins!  take  that  malmal
__label__0 is  going  to  be  full  of  himself  for  no  real  reason  for  the  next  couple  of  hours.  he  also  made  really  good  chocolate  chip  cookies,  from  scratch  by  hand.
__label__0 just  got  a  shot  in  his  ass  for  his  headache,  that  works  like  how  he  imagines  works  like  vicodin  for  house's  leg.  minus  the  addictive  part  that  is.  basicly  *propname*  is  in  a  good  mood  now  that  he  isn't  in  pain.
__label__0 i  have  my  car  back!!  *does  happy  dance*  no  one  witnessed  that.
__label__0 is  praying  for  a  phone  call  from  the  doctors  saying  the  neurologist  accepted  his  referal  and  will  see  him  soon.
__label__0 was  at  uc  yesterday  and  apologizes  if  he  seemed  a  little  out  of  it  today.  they  gave  him  another  pain  shot.
__label__0 just  spent  a  half  hour  ductaping  a  tin  can  only  to  through  it  out.  then  spent  about  an  hour  playing  with  ductape,  and  made  pouch  that  he  will  never  use.  *propname*  feels  really  cool  right  now.  :)
__label__0 "i  just  want  you  to  know  that  i'm  saying  something  brilliant.  i'm  just  not  explaining  it  very  well."
__label__0 has  the  systems  for  higher  brain  function  and  complex  thought  offline  at  the  moment.  we  apologize  for  any  incovience.  (such  as  the  spelling  of  this  update)
__label__0 mr.  frosty,  that  is  the  grand  finish  of  a  good  summer.
__label__0 has  decided  that  the  laws  of  physics  must  not  apply  to  his  project.  one  side  takes  .  seconds  to  drain  water  to  the  other  side.  the  other  side  takes  fron  .  seconds  to  .  seconds  to  empty.  the  same  results  happen  over  and  over  with  no  explanation
__label__0 "just  because  i  know  everything  doesn't  mean  i'll  be  telling  you  anything  true."
__label__0 s  mind  has  decided  to  check  out  for  a  while.  it  left  a  note  saying  it  should  be  back  around    am  tomorrow.
__label__0 s  head  would  explode  if  his  skull  wasn't  being  hammered  on  by  numerious  sledge  hammers.  needless  to  say  my  headache  has  decided  over  the  counter  painkillers  only  make  it  more  angry.
__label__0 "...  and  then  i  have  a  witty  response."  -house
__label__0 i'm  on  call,  to  be  there.
__label__0 "its  only  illegal  if  you  get  caught,  assuming  you're  stupid  enough  to  get  caught  in  the  first  place"
__label__0 feels  the  need  to  say  something  deep  and  profound,  but  its  very  late  and  he  is  tired  from  his  workout  today.  with  those  conditions  this  is  the  best  he's  got.
__label__0 does  all  his  status  updates  in  rd  person.  this  will  likely  never  change.
__label__0 is  exhausted,  stressed,  and  is  having  an  awarding  winning  bad  luck  streak  in  terms  of  things  going  his  way.  but  for  whatever  reason  was  nominated  for  the  homecoming  courts.
__label__0 is  tired  and  probably  sick  but  likes  to  stay  positive  and  think  its  just  allergies(pretty  sure  thats  spelled  wrong  too).  but  had  an  amazing  time  at  a  murder  mystery  party  being  the  main  investigator,  and  was  close  to  getting  the  right  answer  but  didn't  have  enough  information.  he  also  intends  to  finish  polishing  an  essay  for  english  that  is  way  longer  than  any  essay  really  has  the  right  to  be.
__label__0 just  washed  a  paper  plate  so  that  he  could  use  it  for  something  else.  it  would  have  been  easier  to  just  grab  a  new  one  right  next  to  him.
__label__0 has  probably,  most  likely,  lost  what  ever  symbolance  of  a  mind  he  once  held.
__label__0 "she  only  drinks  coffee  at  midnight.  when  the  moment  is  not  right,  and  her  timing  is  quite,  unusual."
__label__0 made  the  most  amazing  burritos  for  dinner  and  feels  sad  that  he  can't  finish  them  and  enjoy  their  great  deliciousness  anylonger...
__label__0 k+car  break  down+friday  the  th=me  feeling  superstious.  k=fail=me  tired
__label__0 is  awsome.  period.
__label__0 got  his  hair  cut  at    today.  he  just  now  hopes  that  he  can  replicate  the  hairstyle  half  as  well  as  the  stylist.
__label__0 s  brain  feels  tired.  stupid  sat  making  be  sit  in  a  room  for    hours  when  it  should  only  take    //
__label__0 is  tired  and  his  pupils  are  still  dominating  each  respective  iris.  can  anyone  say  super  night  vision?
__label__0 just  reliezed  that  devouring  chinese  food  the  night  before  a  k  test  isn't  the  best  choice  of  foods  to  have  consumed  if  he  wanted  to  do  well  on  the  test.
__label__0 saw  the  mouse  trap!  it  was  positively  amazing!!!  great  work  to  everyone!!
__label__0 woke  up  from  sleeping  over    hours  about  a  //  hour  ago.
__label__0 s  sister  ate  x's  more  than  he  did,  she  is  "  and  lbs,  in  her  first  sitting  than  he  did  the  entire  meal.
__label__0 watched  transformers  ii  with  *propname*,  has  a  neuro  appointment  tomorrow  and  can't  find  the  headache  log.  made  pretty  good  pastries,  will  have  them  perfected  when  the  next  batch  is  made.
__label__0 black  friday  shopping+  *propname*=  fun  black  friday  +waking  up  =  hours  of  sleep  yet  somehow  am  oddly  awake  even  if  i've  already  had  a  full  day  before  noon.
__label__0 got  to  sleep  in  like  an  hour  only  to  wake  up  at  .  black  friday  shopping  with  *propname*!!
__label__0 hears  whale  calls.  literally,  there  is  a  nature  video  playing  in  the  backround.
__label__0 has  the  words  "merry  christmas"  written  in  rope  lights  hung  in  the  front  window  of  his  house.
__label__0 "oh  the  weather  outside  is  frightful"
__label__0 still  has  glitter  stuck  on  his  fingers.  thanks  *propname*  :)
__label__0 rawwaarwaarr!!!
__label__0 feels  the  sleepy,  its  not  even  late  yet.
__label__0 hid  in  the  closet  for  the  majority  of  the  day
__label__0 hung  out  at  *propname*'s  today,  wrapping  presents,  then  went  to  the  park  and  played  on  the  swing  sets.  can  anyone  say  awesome??
__label__0 riverside  is  a  strange  and  wonderious,  mostly  strange,  place  were  when  you  show  up  at  noon  you  are  required  to  murder  avocados  and  eat  dinner  at  :.  merry  christmas  world,  i'm  stranded  with  my  family.
__label__0 saw  pictures  of  his  brain  slice  by  slice.  has  mild  brain  damage  from  his  headaches  and  migraines,  non-lethal  so,  !!!!!!  happy!!!!!!!!!
__label__0 if  you're  wondering  if  i  want  you  to,  i  want  you  to.  so  make  a  move,  'cause  i  ain't  got  all  night.-weezer
__label__0 s  head  is  better  finally.
__label__0 loves  his  mind,  hates  his  head.
__label__0 is  eating  dinasour  oatmeal!!
__label__0 thank  you  world.  now  if  you  don't  mind,  i'm  going  to  get  some  sleep.  its  a  new  decade,  that  makes  us  humans  tired.
__label__0 i  have  serenity  in  blue-ray.  its  really  really  cool.
__label__0 is  making  better  than  sex  cake.  it  better  be,  it  certainly  costs  enough.
__label__0 santa  isn't  bringing  me  presents  this  year.  he  sent  mal  and  river  to  do  it,  i  don't  think  he  considered  the  noise  factor  of  serenity  though.  (if  any  of  you  get  the  extreeeemly  geeky  reference  i'm  making,  just  smile  and  accept  that  every  year  i  wish  for  firefly  to  start  up  again)(hint,  hint,  santa)
__label__0 i  harbor  a  strong  distaste  for  ks
__label__0   honest  answer.  you  can  ask  me  one  question  (send  it  to  my  inbox  )  any  question.  no  matter  how  awkward  it  can  be,  i'll  answer  it  honestly.  there's  no  catch  but  i  dare  you  to  post  this  as  your  status  and  see  what  people  ask  you.
__label__0 had  a  great  time  tonight!!

__label__0 "i  don't  know  what  you  do,  but  i  do  thangs"  ....  yah  i  have  no  idea?
__label__0 [c]  legal  writing  sucks.  [r]  something  is  deemed  to  "suck"  if  it  takes  an  innordinate  amount  of  time  to  complete  in  mind  numbing  silence  that  slowly  drives  you  fucking  crazy.  [e]  in  berkovitch  it  was  determined  that  working  on  "pennoyer",  an  outdated  case  that  has  no  bearing  on  actual  modern  day  law  "sucks"  because  it  took  over    hours  and  drove  him  fucking  crazy...

__label__1 preparing  my  mind  for  a  long  drive.  .  .
__label__1 the  woman  came  out  of  a  man's  rib,  not  from  his  feet  to  be  walked  on,  not  from  his  head  to  be  superior,  but  from  his  side  to  be  equal!  under  the  arm  to  be  protected,  &  next  to  the  heart  to  be  loved.

__label__1 wow,  that  was  a  great  game  -  even  if  *propname*  did  lose.  hope  the    v.    game  tonight  is  that  good.
__label__1 really?    two  days  in  a  row?    i  would  like  to  take  back  my  comment  about  de  ja  vu  -  i  didn't  mean  i  wanted  it  to  end  like  that  (again).

__label__1 put  this  as  your  status  if  you  or  somebody  you  know  has  suffered  the  loss  of  a  baby  ?  the  majority  won't  put  it  on  because  unlike  cancer.  baby  loss  is  a  taboo...  break  the  silence  ?  this  is  in  memory  of  all  the  angel  babies...gone  too  soon  but  never  forgotten  about!!?  show  your  support  and  let  these  women  know  they  don't  have  to  grieve  alone.
__label__1 if  you  &  i  woke  up  in  jail  together...using  only  four  words...what  would  you  say  to  me?  copy  and  paste  this  in  your  status  and  see  what  funny  things  your  friends  say....(and  if  you  make  a  comment,  you  gotta  put  this  in  your  status.  fair  is  fair.)
__label__1 if  i  ruled  the  world  .  .  .  imagine  that  .  .  .

__label__0 avril  stuck  in  my  head  from  yesterdays  singing  performance.  soooo  sad
__label__0 freezing  my  freakin  ass  off.  don't  want  to  get  out  of  bed  for  anything  today  :(

__label__0 mainstream.  all  day  long...  kill  it.
__label__0 goddam  it.  this  celebrity  double  thing  is  driving  me  crazy.  help
__label__1 just  remembered,  i  seen  a  naked  guy  running  up  the  supports  on  the  squinty  bridge  last  night  with  all  hanging  out  ..  but  wearing  socks.  not  a  pretty  sight.
__label__1 seen  a  leaflet  guy  coming  into  building.  so  i  collected  together  all  the  leaflets  we  have  (about  -)  and  when  he  went  to  post  the  leaflets  i  posted  them  all  outwards  as  he  opened  the  letterbox.  he  looked  a  little  confused  and  tried  to  push  them  back,  so  i  posted  them  back  out  again.  ahh  its  fun  to  piss  off  people.
__label__1 feeling  like  crap,  no  temperature  though  so  at  least  its  not  swine  flu  (at  least  i  think  its  not!)
__label__1 got  a  pair  of  degu's  last  night,  already  causing  issues!  they  are  uber  cute  though.
__label__1 got  a  refferal  to  a  ent  specialist  so  i  can  get  a  camera  jammed  up  my  nose  into  my  sinuses.  not  pretty  but  at  least  i  may  be  able  to  finally  get  rid  of  this  damn  sinus  infection!  :d
__label__1 trying  to  send  docs  to  the  bank,  and  my  personal  advisor  is  not  trusted  with  email  or  web  access  full  access  to  my  account,  financial  and  personal,  but  not  email  *worry*
__label__1 gotta  love    mobile.  i  asked  to  cancel  my  contract  and  was  asked  "could  we  convince  you  to  stay"  i  replied  with  "due  to  the  terrible  customer  service,  i  would  rather  die  a  slow  and  horribly  painful  death  than  stay"  to  which  i  got  "do  you  have  any  friends  or  relatives  you  would  like  to  refer  so  they  can  get  a  good  deal".  i  want  that  csr  to  work  in  my  company  retention  department!!
__label__1 i  think  i  must  be  doing  something  wrong  on  the  trapeze,  it  feels  like  i  have  just  went  for  a  vasectomy  after  trying  a  few  windmills  yesterday.  no  pain  no  gain  :)

__label__1 trying  to  weigh  a  degu  is  not  easy!
__label__1 never  had  a  crab,  squid,  musccle,  scallop,  and  anchovie  pizza  before.  it  is  however  suprisingly  good  :)
__label__1 whilst  i  may  not  understand  the  history  behind  thanksgiving,  i  can  get  behind  any  holiday  that  consists  of  a  huge  amount  of  food,  alcohol  and  friends.  happy  thanksgiving  to  my  american  friends.  and  to  anyone  else,  today  is  just  an  excuse  for  us  to  take  part  in  "cultural  diversity"  and  get  drunk  and  stuffed  with  lots  of  food.
__label__1 is  thinking  that  he  needs  to  assemble  a  horde  of  flying  panda  colored  monkies  to  wreck  havock  on  the  world  from  above,  and  buy  milk.
__label__1 i  can  handle  the  scope  thing  being  shoved  up  my  nose  and  down  my  throat,  i  can  handle  the  ct  scan,  but  having  blood  taken,  still  can't  deal  with  that!
__label__1 why  are  you  not  allowed  to  give  kids  nuts  for  halloween  any  more.  i  got  them  as  a  kid,  and  as  far  as  i  am  aware  people  havne't  become  more  allergic  to  it  in  the  last    years,  just  the  same  amount.
__label__1 hates  facebook  messaging,  it  always  looks  like  you  are  waiting  for  the  other  person  to  message  back,  and  then  you  see  that  it  has  infact  timed  out  (again)  and  the  person  messaged  back    hours  ago.  *sigh*
__label__1 i  have  discovered  the  'teddy  bear'  move  in  aerials,  is  anything  but  cute  and  fluffy!  its  evil,  sore  and  likes  nothing  more  than  cutting  off  all  blood  to  your  extrematies.
__label__1 is  currently  working  his  way  through  the  harry  potter  box  set.  can't  say  i  don't  have  exciting  weekends!
__label__1 i  know    sick  people  at  the  moment,  and  now  i'm  sick.  i'm  going  to  find  out  what  one  it  was  and  come  after  them!!  watch  yourselves  ;)
__label__1 happy  jul,  in  norway  they  don't  celebrate  chriastmas  as  much  as  julaften  (pre-christmas).  thats  when  people  get  their  pressies.  in  russia  its  the  th  jan!    don't  know  if  i  could  wait  that  long!
__label__1 i  love  how  much  fun  you  can  have  with  non  newtonian  fluids  :d
__label__1 the  turkey  is  now  officially  drunk  (injected  with  enough  alcohol  that  if  we  didn't  eat  it,  it'd  be  at  aa).  rubbed  with  secret  spices,  drizzled  in  bacon,  and  the  silverside  joint  is  slowly  cooking  for    hours.    minute  break  then    back  to  cooking  :d
__label__1 my  brother  gave  me  a  uni-cycle  for  xmas.  i'm  wondering  if  you  can  pre  book  appointments  to  the  a&e  to  save  time.
__label__1 just  hacked  my  appletv,  removed  the  wifi  chip  and  replaced  with  a  broadcom  h.  hardware  decoder  chip.  now  i  can  stream  blu  ray  movies  in  p  from  my  fileserver  to  tv  :d
__label__1 just  realised  he  missed  the  aerial  class  start  :|  thought  it  was  next  week  it  started  doh!
__label__1 thinks  that  the  new  apple  tablet  'pc'  ipad  sounds  like  a  high  tech  sanitary  device.
__label__1 merry  christmas  everyone  :)
__label__1 they  are  not  beef  sausages  if  they  are  only  %  beef!  lies!
__label__1 just  made  a  spiced  haddock  on  trimmed  green  bean  and  coconut  rice  with  a  coconut,  chilli  sauce...  mmm
__label__0 it's  time  i  fire  up  this  life  i'm  livin'  in!
__label__0 cuando  la  vida  misma  te  ha  puesto  en  un  aprieto,  �qu�  es  lo  que  se  debe  hacer?
__label__0 que  es  lo  que  en  realidad  se  debe  de  hacer?  lo  que  el  coraz�n  dicta  o  lo  que  la  razon  te  dice?
__label__0 es  momento  de  aprender  a  dejar  ir  las  cosas.  por  favor,  que  aquella  luz,  gu�a  m�a,  me  lleve  a  los  lugares  indicados.
__label__0 oscilando  entre  la  infinidad  de  la  mente  y  la  infinidad  del  sue�o...
__label__0 hay  veces  en  las  que  simplemente  quisiera  olvidarme  de  todo  y  refugiarme  en  la  profundidad  de  mi  mente...
__label__0 meus  somnerium...  en  busca  de  un  peque�o  momento  de  comprensi�n...
__label__0 de  vuelta  al  mundo  interno  sin  l�mites!
__label__0 por  favor,  que  las  cosas  mejoren!  si  es  que  en  verdad  alguien  puede  ayudar,  que  le  otorguen  lo  que  necesita!
__label__0 getting  ready  for  the  fun!  escapada  espiritual  al  coraz�n  del  or�culo...  riviera  maya!  meus  somnierum!
__label__0 i  want  to  reconcile  the  violence  in  your  heart!  i  want  to  recognise  your  beauty  is  not  just  a  mask!  i  want  to  exorcise  the  demons  from  your  past!  i  want  to  satisfy  the  undisclosed  desires  in  your  heart!  (gracias  a  sofi  por  la  canci�n  tan  genial!)
__label__0 i  just...  don't  know  what  to  think  anymore...
__label__0 life  truly  has  special  ways  to  show  us  what  we  need...  in  the  weirdest  moments////f  i  n  a  l  f  a  n  t  a  s  y////"i  know.  i'm  not  alone...  not  anymore."
__label__0 back  to  the  routine,  then...
__label__1 is  trying  to  get  out  of  the  doldrums
__label__1 is  in  aruba!!!
__label__1 --  people  need  to  get  over  michael  vick's  life  and  get  their  own
__label__1 vegas  baby!!!  yaaa!!!!
__label__1 once  again  doesn't  remember  going  to  bed.  and  she's  upset  with  how  much  drunk  *propname*  tries  to  screw  around  with  hungover  *propname*.  this  isn't  funny  drunk  *propname*.
__label__1 is  glad  that  it's  summertime,  and  the  living  is  easy.  one  of  these  mornings,  she'll  rise  up  singing.
__label__1 just  got  home  from  spending    glorious  hours  with  her  family.  it  was  an  awesome  day.  sorry  for  all  the  missed  calls  and  texts,  my  phone  died  many  hours  ago.
__label__1 i'm  leavin'  on  a  cruise  ship,  but  i  do  know  when  i'll  be  back  again.  seriously  though,  no  phone  or  internet  all  week,  so  i  will  be  incommunicado.  you  kids  have  fun,  try  not  to  do  anything  too  crazy.
__label__1 is  home  again!  the  caribbean  was  amazing!
__label__1 had  good  talkings  tonight.  fun  times  were  had  by  all.
__label__1 one  more  double  before  nine  days  of  freedom.
__label__1 can't  stop  here!  this  is  bat  country!
__label__1 you  win  some,  you  lose  some.  week    doesn't  say  anything  about  the  playoffs.  there's  always  next  week.  and  lets  be  fair,  the  competition  next  week  is  the  chiefs.  ahahaha.
__label__1 ought  to  be  cast  in  the  next  big  zombie  movie  as  an  extra.  because  she  feels  like  the  living  dead  must  feel  after  a  night  of  heavy  brain-eating.  is  that  their  equivalent  of  drinking?  explains  why  they  want  to  do  it  all  the  time.
__label__1 needs  to  be  herself,  she  can't  be  no  one  else.  she's  feeling  supersonic,  give  her  gin  and  tonic.  she  could  have  it  all,  but  how  much  does  she  want  it?
__label__1 damn,  those  eagles  looked  sharp  today.  too  bad  the  red  sox  couldn't  do  the  same.
__label__1 made  some  cash  last  night  playing  poker.  hopefully  a  repeat  performance  tonight?
__label__1 hasn't  felt  the  way  she  feels  today  in  so  long  it's  hard  for  her  to  specify.
__label__1 has  got  no  time  to  for  spreadin  roots,  the  time  has  come  to  be  gone.  and  though  our  health  we  drank  a  thousand  times,  it's  time  to  ramble  on.
__label__1 is  at  a  weird  place  in  her  life  right  now.  a  road  map  would  be  handy.
__label__1 has  the  damn  flu.  could  the  universe's  timing  have  been  any  worse?  she  thinks  not.
__label__1 woot,  go  chiefs.  :d
__label__1 would  love  to  have  something  that  even  remotely  resembles  a  reasonable  sleep  schedule.
__label__1 feels  severely  under-appreciated.  it's  lame.
__label__1 has  had  a  very  good  day,  and  looks  to  have  a  good  night  also.
__label__1 doesn't  look  different,  but  she  has  changed.  you're  looking  through  her,  she's  not  the  same.
__label__1 wants  to  live  where  soul  meets  body,  and  let  the  sun  wrap  its  arms  around  her,  and  bathe  her  skin  in  water  cool  and  cleansing,  and  feel,  feel  what  it's  like  to  be  new.
__label__1 has  learned  that  standing  in  front  of  her  open  refridgerator  and  freezer  doesn't  make  any  of  her  food  look  any  more  appetizing,  but  it  does  start  defrosting  the  food  in  her  freezer.
__label__1 proved  her  epic  ninja  skills  tonight.
__label__1 shall  live  in  the  sunshine,  swim  the  sea,  and  drink  the  wild  air's  salubrity.
__label__1 was  hoping  some  of  the  punk  kids  in  her  apartment  complex  would  nab  the  jack-o-lanterns  off  her  balcony  and  give  them  the  honor  of  a  good  smash.  instead  she  had  to  unceremoniously  toss  them  in  the  dumpster.
__label__1 will  begin  tomorrow  well  and  serenely  and  with  too  high  a  spirit  to  be  encumbered  with  her  old  nonsense.
__label__1 is  gonna  blame  it  all  upon  a  rush  of  blood  to  the  head.
__label__1 had  one  of  her  worst  nights  ever  at  work,  after  spending  all  day  actually  believing  today  would  be  a  good  day.
__label__1 will  have  a  bit  of  fun,  watching  everyone  pass  her  by.
__label__1 is  sitting  in  an  english  garden,  waiting  for  the  sun.
__label__1 ():  fact:  the  drinking  you  do  in  college  doesn't  affect  your  liver  in  real  life.
__label__1 wanted  more  than  life  could  ever  grant.  she's  bored  with  the  chore  of  saving  face.
__label__1 loves  that  she  has  some  of  the  nerdiest  friends  ever.  she's  seen  at  least  ten  *propname*  poems  posted  today.  granted,  everyone  picks  the  same  one  from  v  for  vendetta,  but  m'eh.
__label__1 is  feeling  uninspired  and  unmotivated.  can  someone  else  please  pay  her  bills  and  move  her  into  her  new  apartment?
__label__1 is  tired  of  being  passed  over.
__label__1 has  gotta  tell  you  what  a  state  she's  in...
__label__1 is  having  the  worst  day  since  yesterday.
__label__1 learns  more  and  more  every  day  that  timing  is  everything.
__label__1 is  still  living  with  your  ghost,  lonely  and  dreaming  of  the  west  coast.  she  just  wants  to  feel  some  sunshine.
__label__1 just  thought  that  you  would  know  you're  a  god,  and  she  is  not.
__label__1 took  these  broken  wings  and  learned  to  fly.  all  her  life,  she  was  only  waiting  for  this  moment  to  arise.
__label__1 doesn't  want  to  be  at  the  mercy  of  her  emotions.  she  wants  to  use  them,  to  enjoy  them,  and  to  dominate  them.
__label__1 is  watching  the  lights  go  down,  letting  the  cables  sleep.  whatever  you  say,  it's  all  right,  whatever  you  do  it's  all  good.
__label__1 is  simultaneously  packing,  doing  laundry,  cleaning,  and  jamming  out.    ah,  productivity.
__label__1 is  home  from  work  and  back  to  packing//cleaning.  january  nd  can't  come  soon  enough,  because  this  is  starting  to  get  really  monotonous.
__label__1 can  be  painfully  petty  and  selfish  at  times.
__label__1 doppelg�nger  week;  change  your  profile  picture  to  someone  famous  you  have  been  told  you  look  like.  after  you  update  your  profile  with  your  evil  twin  photo,  then  cut  and  paste  this  to  your  status.
__label__1 wants  the  kind  of  things  that  money  just  can't  buy.
__label__1 hates  to  admit  that  she's  becoming  more  and  more  of  a  morning  person.
__label__1 is  very  glad  to  see  that  it's  legitimately  storming  outside.  if  only  she  didn't  have  to  go  back  to  work  in  just  a  few  minutes...
__label__1 is,  by  far,  the  biggest  nerd  she  knows  sometimes.  which  really  says  a  lot  if  you  know  her  friends.
__label__1 just  realized  she's  been  awake  for    hours.  that  might  explain  the  exhaustion.
__label__1 had  an  amazing  night  last  night,  in  spite  of  the  fact  that  she  was  literally  falling  asleep  on  her  feet.
__label__1 your  grace  is  more  than  enough.  re-prioritization  in  progress.
__label__1 stepped  down  from  the  last  stage.  but  i  won't  say  goodbye.  well  done,  *propname*:)
__label__1 free  style
__label__1 loves  his  ginosko  ppl.
__label__1 losing  trust  on  all  those  facebook  quizzes.  just  look  on  my  wall.  lol
__label__1 where  r  u  god?
__label__1 is  planning  on  trying  ????  starting  this  week
__label__1 once  was  lost  but  now  am  found.  repenting  my  absurd  arrogance.
__label__1 merry  christmas!  much  blessings  and  love~~~
__label__1 is  having  a  busy  day  at  work  on  the  day  he  shouldn't  even  be  working!
__label__1 walking  away,  with  blessings  behind.
__label__1 the  best  day  is  always  today!

__label__0 is  confused.
__label__0 is  writing  a  paper  that  is  due  tomorrow...  what?  i  should  be  writing  it  instead  of  writing  this  status?  if  you  say  so...
__label__0 oh  the  irony...  i  am  a  dork.
__label__0 only    chapters  left  to  read...

__label__0 look  at  spot.  spin.  attempt  to  find  spot.  where  is  spot?  oh.  behind  me.  that  was  not    degrees.  darn.
__label__0 is  done  with  her  paper!  now  to  the  next  one...
__label__0 superbowl  monday!!!  we  should  make  it  an  official  holiday.
__label__0 so  much  for  no  accumulation...  :-)
__label__0 summer!!
__label__0 it  needs  to  be  sunny  so  i  can  invite  a  bunch  of  peeps  over
__label__0 i  have  never  changed  my  facebook  pic  ever,  that  should  be  a  record  right?
__label__0 is  sleepy  and  doesn't  want  to  pack
__label__0 is  leaving  soon
__label__0 has  been  putting  off  patching  up  the  holes  in  her  clothing...and  it's  starting  to  show.
__label__0 is  trying  to  get  her  hearing  back  after  nibbler  decided  to  imitate  her  sneezing...very  loudly.
__label__0 is  awake  and  packing..  ;__;
__label__0 is  sick  and  tired  of  marketing.
__label__0 just  rubbed  red  pepper  oil  in  her  eye.  ;____;  fuck.
__label__0 "this  is  your  life  and  it's  ending  one  minute  at  a  time."
__label__0 is  off  camping
__label__0 can't  figure  out  how  to  get  her  hair  cut.  any  suggestions?
__label__0 "the  world  is  my  ashtray"
__label__0 is  blowing  magnificent  spit  bubbles.
__label__0 needs  to  stop  buying  things  online  or  she's  going  to  be  penniless.
__label__0 is  in  lake  placid  and  it's  wonderful.
__label__0 needs  to  finish  her  work...but  is  very  lazy.
__label__0 can't  sleep  again.
__label__0 should  give  up  on  art  and  be  a  scientist.
__label__0 has  nothing  to  do  today.
__label__0 should  give  up  on  being  a  scientist  and  become  a  cave  hermit.
__label__0 should  stop  wasting  her  time,  go  to  college  and  get  a  real  job.
__label__0 is  too  liberal  for  canandaigua.
__label__0 really  loves  the  fall
__label__0 "but  he  hung  up  the  phone  slow  and  sad.  dad  said  "the  worst  thing  about  living  here  is  that  you  can  only  kill  yourself  once.""
__label__0 looks  sick  most  of  the  time.
__label__0 well,  see  what  you  want  to  see,  you  should  see  it  all.  well,  take  what  you  want  from  me,  you  deserve  it  all.  nine  times  out  of  ten  our  hearts  just  get  dissolved.  well,  i  want  a  better  place  or  just  a  better  way  to  fall.
__label__0 is  trying  to  find  an  apartment.
__label__0 should  probably  go  to  sleep  soon..
__label__0 hasn't  been  online  in  a  long  time
__label__0 packing  up  my  crap  and  moving  this  week.  i  can't  afford  cable  or  internet  service  so  you'll  have  to  text  me  if  you  want  to  talk  to  me.  my  phone  number  is  -  if  you  didn't  already  know.
__label__0 bored  with  things,  i  need  to  find  something  else  to  focus  on  obsessively.

__label__0 need  to  do  calc
__label__0 grilling  with  the  battalion
__label__0 working  on  calculus
__label__0 military  science  iii
__label__0 had  to  move  to  delta
__label__0 there  is  no  squabbling  so  violent  as  that  between  people  who  accepted  an  idea  yesterday  and  those  who  will  accept  the  same  idea  tomorrow.
__label__0 back  to  class
__label__0 battalion  level  smoke  session  at  
__label__0 calc,  history,  comp,  then  chem
__label__0 height  and  weight  test  under  bravo
__label__0 chem  and  then  im  done  with  classes  for  the  day
__label__0 i  hate  wednesdays
__label__0 adversity  causes  some  men  to  break,  others  to  break  records............  ..back  from  the  gym
__label__0 ms  iii  class
__label__0 phone  sucks
__label__0 i  apologize  for  my  last  status  no  real  smoke  session  took  place...im  not  sure  what  it  was
__label__0 no
__label__0 dream  as  if  you  have  forever.  live  as  if  you  only  have  today
__label__0 going  to  the  gym
__label__0 think  what  a  better  world  it  would  be  if  we  all,  the  whole  world,  had  cookies  and  milk  about  three  o'clock  every  afternoon  and  then  lay  down  on  our  blankets  for  a  nap...
__label__0 do  not  go  where  the  path  may  lead,  go  instead  where  there  is  no  path  and  leave  a  trail
__label__0 parade  practice...worst  time  of  the  day
__label__0 he  who  strikes  first,  strikes  twice.
__label__0 it's  amazing  that  the  amount  of  news  that  happens  in  the  world  every  day  always  just  exactly  fits  the  newspaper
__label__0 anybody  who  wants  to  do  stx  lanes  tonight  report  to  delta  barracks  by  ...full  battle  rattle..this  includes  rucksack,lbv  with  compass  and  water,  dummy  rifle,  and  redlines  flashlight..have  assault  pack  in  rucksack  bring  kevlar  and  pc
__label__0 going  to  the  gym...hit  me  up  later
__label__0 some  people  walk  in  the  rain,  others  just  get  wet
__label__0 anyone  who  can  be  replaced  by  a  machine  deserves  to  be
__label__0 may  have  overworked  my  abs  today...feel  torn
__label__0 the  undertaking  of  a  new  action  brings  new  strength
__label__0 going  for  a  long  run  hit  me  up  later
__label__0 most  people  never  run  far  enough  on  their  first  wind  to  find  out  they've  got  a  second
__label__0 i  like  running  because  it's  a  challenge.    if  you  run  hard,  there's  the  pain  -  and  you've  got  to  work  your  way  through  the  pain.    you  know,  lately  it  seems  all  you  hear  is?  don't  overdo  it'  and?  don't  push  yourself.'  well,  i  think  that's  a  lot  of  bull  shit.    if  you  push  the  human  body,  it  will  respond
__label__0 the  person  who  says  it  cannot  be  done  should  not  interrupt  the  person  doing  it.
__label__0 the  trouble  with  being  punctual  is  that  nobody's  there  to  appreciate  it
__label__0 if  you  want  to  be  a  leader  try  and  act  like  one
__label__0 there  is  genius  in  persistence.  it  conquers  all  opposers.  it  gives  confidence.  it  annihilates  obstacles.  everybody  believes  in  a  determined  man.  people  know  that  when  he  undertakes  a  thing,  the  battle  is  half  won,  for  his  rule  is  to  accomplish  whatever  he  sets  out  to  do.
__label__0 if  i  am  not  for  myself,  who  will  be  for  me?  if  i  am  not  for  others,  what  am  i?and  if  not  now,  when?
__label__0 lunch  then  going  to  work  out....any  workout  which  does  not  involve  a  certain  amount  of  danger  or  responsibility  does  not  improve  the  body  -  it  just  wears  it  out
__label__0 the  first  rule  is  to  keep  an  untroubled  spirit.  the  second  is  to  look  things  in  the  face  and  know  them  for  what  they  are
__label__0 you  don't  drown  by  falling  in  water.  you  drown  by  staying  there.
__label__0 if  i  had  to  select  one  quality,  one  personal  characteristic  that  i  regard  as  being  most  highly  correlated  with  success,  whatever  the  field,  i  would  pick  the  trait  of  persistence.  determination.  the  will  to  endure  to  the  end,  to  get  knocked  down  seventy  times  and  get  up  off  the  floor  saying,  ''here  comes  number  seventy-one!
__label__0 .if  we  wait  for  the  moment  when  everything,    absolutely  everything  is  ready,  we  shall  never  begin
__label__0 getting  smoked  tonight
__label__0 i'm  a  great  believer  in  luck,  and  i  find  the  harder  i  work,  the  more  i  have  of  it.
__label__0 your  toughness  is  made  up  of  equal  parts  persistence  and  experience.  you  don't  so  much  outrun  your  opponents  as  outlast  and  outsmart  them,  and  the  toughest  opponent  of  all  is  the  one  inside  your  head
__label__0 going  on  a  run
__label__0 monday..enough  said
__label__0 jealousy  is  the  tribute  mediocrity  pays  to  genius.
__label__0 i  long  to  accomplish  a  great  and  noble  task,  but  it  is  my  chief  duty  to  accomplish  humble  tasks  as  though  they  were  great  and  noble
__label__0 the  average  estimate  themselves  by  what  they  do,  the  above  average  by  what  they  are
__label__0 phones  dead
__label__0 running  the  course,  then  to  the  weight  room
__label__0 personally,  i  don't  think  there's  intelligent  life  on  other  planets.  why  should  other  planets  be  any  different  from  this  one?
__label__0 since  the  house  is  on  fire  let  us  warm  ourselves
__label__0 going  to  the  qm
__label__0 msc  iii  class..
__label__0 good  day...goodnight
__label__0 got  my  battle  rattle  ready
__label__0 education  is  a  progressive  discovery  of  our  own  ignorance
__label__0 common  sense  in  an  uncommon  degree  is  what  the  world  calls  wisdom
__label__0 executive  ability  is  deciding  quickly  and  getting  somebody  else  to  do  the  work.
__label__0 those  who  live  by  the  sword  get  shot  by  those  who  don't.
__label__0 why  did  i  want  to  win?  because  i  didn't  want  to  lose!
__label__0 despise  the  fact  i  have  already  been  up  for  almost    hours
__label__0 nothing  in  the  world  can  take  the  place  of  persistence.  talent  will  not;  nothing  is  more  common  than  unsuccessful  men  with  talent.  genius  will  not;  unrewarded  genius  is  almost  proverb.  education  will  not;  the  world  is  full  of  educated  derelicts.  persistence  and  determination  alone  are  omnipotent
__label__0 the  will  to  win  means  nothing  without  the  will  to  prepare
__label__0 excellence  is  an  art  won  by  training  and  habituation.  we  do  not  act  rightly  because  we  have  virtue  or  excellence,  but  we  rather  have  those  because  we  have  acted  rightly.  we  are  what  we  repeatedly  do.  excellence,  then,  is  not  an  act  but  a  habit.
__label__0 i've  got  a  great  ambition  to  die  of  exhaustion  rather  than  boredom
__label__0 if  life  gives  you  lemons  -  make  grapejuice.  then  sit  back  and  let  people  wonder  how  you  did  it.
__label__0 since  light  travels  faster  than  sound,    people  appear  bright  until  you  hear  them  speak
__label__0 if  you  can't  convince  them,  confuse  them
__label__0 first  free  weekend
__label__0 the  power  of  accurate  observation  is  frequently  called  cynicism  by  those  who  don't  have  it
__label__0 far  better  it  is  to  dare  mighty  things,  to  win  glorious  triumphs  even  though  checkered  by  failure,  than  to  rank  with  those  poor  spirits  who  neither  enjoy  nor  suffer  much  because  they  live  in  the  gray  twilight  that  knows  neither  victory  nor  defeat.
__label__0 here's  to  you  and  here's  to  me,  and  i  hope  we  never  disagree.  but,  if  that  should  ever  be,  to  hell  with  you,  here's  to  me
__label__0 just  because  everything's  different  doesn't  mean  anything's  changed
__label__0 as  it  is  the  characteristic  of  great  wits  to  say  much  in  few  words,  so  small  wits  seem  to  have  the  gift  of  speaking  much  and  saying  nothing.
__label__0 it  doesn't  work  to  leap  a  twenty-foot  canyon  in  two  ten-foot  jumps
__label__0 common  sense  is  instinct.    enough  of  it  is  genius
__label__0 finished  ruck  run
__label__0 i've  always  felt  it  was  not  up  to  anyone  else  to  make  me  give  my  best
__label__0 sometimes                                                        it  is  entirely  appropriate  to  kill  a  fly  with  a  sledge                                                        hammer
__label__0 chem  test
__label__0 dreams  permit  each  and  every  one  of  us  to  be  quietly  and  safely  insane  every  night  of  our  lives
__label__0 i'm  not  the  greatest;  i'm  the  double  greatest.  not  only  do  i  knock  'em  out,  i  pick  the  round.
__label__0 if  one  can  stick  to  the  training  throughout  the  many  long  years,  then  will  power  is  no  longer  a  problem.  it's  raining?  that  doesn't  matter.  i  am  tired?  that's  besides  the  point.  it's  simply  that  i  just  have  to
__label__0 it  seems  rather  incongruous  that  in  a  society  of  supersophisticated  communication,  we  often  suffer  from  a  shortage  of  listeners
__label__0 if  the  path  less  traveled  were  the  easy  path,  then  all  would  take  it,  thus  making  greatness  simply  average
__label__0 people  demand  freedom  of  speech  to  make  up    for  the  freedom  of  thought  which  they  avoid
__label__0 no  matter  where  you  go,  there  you  are
__label__0 there  is  no  point  at  which  you  can  say,  well,  i'm  successful  now.  i  might  as  well  take  a  nap
__label__0 just  got  back  from  rugby  and  the  weight  room,  going  to  eat....hit  me  up  later
__label__0 if                                                        you're  in  a  fair  fight,  you  didn't  plan  it  properly
__label__0 your                          problem  is  that  you  think  you  have  time
__label__0 light  thinks  it  travels  faster  than  anything  but  it  is  wrong.  no  matter  how  fast  light  travels,  it  finds  the  darkness  has  always  got  there  first,  and  is  waiting  for  it.
__label__0 it's  amazing  that  the  amount  of  news  that  happens  in  the  world  every  day  always  just  exactly  fits  the  newspaper
__label__0 perseverance  is  more  than  endurance.  it  is  endurance  combined  with  absolute  assurance  and  certainty  that  what  we  are  looking  for  is  going  to  happen
__label__0 before  you  criticize  someone,  you  should  walk  a  mile  in  their  shoes.  that  way  when  you  criticize  them,  you  are  a  mile  away  from  them  and  you  have  their  shoes
__label__0 it  is  the  characteristic  excellence  of  the  strong  man  that  he  can  bring  momentous  issues  to  the  fore  and  make  a  decision  about  them.  the  weak  are  always  forced  to  decide  between  alternatives  they  have  not  chosen  themselves.
__label__0 i  can  picture  in  my  mind  a  world  without  war,  a  world  without  hate.  and  i  can  picture  us  attacking  that  world,  because  they'd  never  expect  it
__label__0 motivation  is  a  fire  from  within.  if  someone  else  tries  to  light  that  fire  under  you,  chances  are  it  will  burn  very  briefly
__label__0 surprise  me
__label__0 success  is  not  the  result  of  spontaneous  combustion.  you  must  set  yourself  on  fire.
__label__0 if  a  cluttered  desk  is  the  sign  of  a  cluttered  mind,  what  is  the  significance  of  a  clean  desk?
__label__0 believing  requires  action
__label__0 between  two  evils  i  always  pick  the  one  ive  never  tried  before
__label__0 those  who  are  more  adapted  to  the  active  life  can  prepare  themselves  for  contemplation  in  the  practice  of  the  active  life,  while  those  who  are  more  adapted  to  the  contemplative  life  can  take  upon  themselves  the  works  of  the  active  life  so  as  to  become  yet  more  apt  for  contemplation
__label__0 where  am  i?
__label__0 thinking  is  more  interesting  than  knowing,  but  less  interesting  than  looking
__label__0 man  imposes  his  own  limitations,  don't  set  any
__label__0 we  run,  not  because  we  think  it  is  doing  us  good,  but  because  we  enjoy  it  and  cannot  help  ourselves...the  more  restricted  our  society  and  work  become,  the  more  necessary  it  will  be  to  find  some  outlet  for  this  craving  for  freedom.    no  one  can  say,  'you  must  not  run  faster  than  this,  or  hump  higher  than  that.'    the  human  spirit  is  indomitable
__label__0 what  i  must  do  is  all  that  concerns  me.  this  rule,  equally  arduous  in  actual  and  intellectual  life,  may  serve  for  the  whole  distinction  between  greatness  and  meanness.  it  is  harder  because  you  will  always  find  those  who  think  they  know  what  is  your  duty  better  than  you  know  it.
__label__0 restlessness  is  dicontent,  and  discontent  is  the  first  neccesity  of  progress
__label__0 i  cannot  have  survival  as  my  only  goal.    that  would  be  too  boring.
__label__0 http:////www.youtube.com//watch?v=kznto_efq&feature=playlist&p=edccfc&index=
__label__0 the  slower  we  move  the  faster  we  die
__label__0 one  reason  we  resist  making  deliberate  choices  is  that  choice  equals  change  and  most  of  us,  feeling  the  world  is  unpredictable  enough,  try  to  minimise  the  trauma  of  change  in  our  personal  lives.
__label__0 there  are  four  ways,  and  only  four  ways,  in  which  we  have  contact  with  the  world.  we  are  evaluated  and  classified  by  these  four  contacts:  what  we  do,  how  we  look,  what  we  say,  and  how  we  say  it.
__label__0 success  is  often  achieved  by  those  who  don't  know  that  failure  is  inevitable.
__label__0 workouts  are  like  brushing  my  teeth;  i  don't  think  about  them,  i  just  do  them.    the  decision  has  already  been  made
__label__0 leadership  is  no  more  confined  to  process,  than  writing  is  to  format
__label__0 staying  up  late  reading  an  analysis  of  caesars  civil  war  a  man  who  lived  by  the  quote  audacity,  more  audacity,  always  audacity,  his  amazing  success  in  life,  war,  and  politics  is  yet  another  hwever  old  testament  that  fortune  trully  does  favor  the  audacious  a  saying  that  seems  to  hold  more  truth  with  every  experience  i  have
__label__0 everyone  is  trying  to  accomplish  something  big,  not  realizing  that  life  is  made  up  of  little  things
__label__0 not  gonna  sleep  good  tonight
__label__0 no  bees,  no  honey;  no  work,  no  money.
__label__0 that  was  fun
__label__0 i  hate  the  expression  "what  makes  him  tick."    it  is  the  american  mind,  looking  for  simple  and  singular  solution,  that  uses  the  foolish  expression.    a  person  not  only  ticks,  he  also  chimes  and  strikes  the  hour,  falls  and  breaks  and  has  to  be  put  together  again,  and  sometimes  stops  like  an  electric  clock  in  a  thunderstorm
__label__0 going  to  work  out..then  mapping  and  setting  up  stx  lanes  for  tonight  hit  me  up  if  you  want  in
__label__0 fight  one  more  round.  when  your  arms  are  so  tired  that  you  can  hardly  lift  your  hands  to  come  on  guard,  fight  one  more  round.  when  your  nose  is  bleeding  and  your  eyes  are  black  and  you  are  so  tired  that  you  wish  your  opponent  would  crack  you  one  on  the  jaw  and  put  you  to  sleep,  fight  one  more  round  �  remembering  that  the  man  who  always  fights  one  more  round  is  never  beaten
__label__0 earlier  tonight,  i  found  a  picture  of  waldo  in  jail.  i  didn't  think  much  of  it  until  i  realized  he  was  probably  a  wanted  fugitive  and  that's  why  he  is  always  hiding
__label__0 what  is  opportunity  to  the  man  who  can't  use  it?
__label__0 dont  you  find  it  funny  that  after  monday(m)  and  tuesday(t),  the  rest  of  the  week  says  wtf?
__label__0 the  truth  is  that  our  finest  moments  are  most  likely  to  occur  when  we  are  feeling  deeply  uncomfortable,  unhappy,  or  unfulfilled.  for  it  is  only  in  such  moments,  propelled  by  our  discomfort,  that  we  are  likely  to  step  out  of  our  ruts  and  start  searching  for  different  ways  or  truer  answers
__label__0 read,  every  day,  something  no  one  else  is  reading.  think,  everyday,  something  no  one  else  is  thinking.  do,  every  day,  something  no  one  else  would  be  crazy  enough  to  do.
__label__0 someday
__label__0 there  is  no  better  time  than  now.  the  time  to  live  is  now.  the  time  to  dream  is  now.  the  time  to  imagine  and  forget  the  past  is  now.  the  time  to  shine  is  now.  the  time  to  bleed,  sweat,  and  determine  yourself  for  the  things  you  want  most  is  now.
__label__0 all  things  are  subject  to  interpretation  whichever  interpretation  prevails  at  a  given  time  is  a  function  of  power  and  not  truth.
__label__0 all  change  is  not  growth;  as  all  movement  is  not  forward.
__label__0 stx  on  friday  hit  me  up  if  you  want  in....the  greatest  potential  for  control  tends  to  exist  at  the  point  where  action  takes  place.
__label__0 dream  great...achieve  greatness
__label__0 our  business  in  life  is  not  to  get  ahead  of  others,  but  to  get  ahead  of  ourselves  --  to  break  our  own  records,  to  outstrip  our  yesterday  by  our  today.
__label__0 when  you  aim  for  perfection,  you    discover  it's  a  moving  target.
__label__0 go  to  urbandictionary.com,  type  in  your  first  name,  copy  and  paste  this  as  your  status,  and  put  the  first  entry  under  your  name  as  a  comment.
__label__0 my  alarm  clock  &  i  had  a  fight.  it  wanted  me  to  get  up,  i  refused.  things  escalated.  now  i'm  awake  &  it�s  broken.  not  sure  who  won  the  fight
__label__0 try  to  learn  something  about  everything  and  everything  about  something
__label__0 think..see.  ..act...
__label__0 a  failure  establishes  only  this,  that  our  determination  to  succeed  was  not  strong  enough
__label__0 don't  always  think  in  a  straight  line
__label__0 we  do  not  rise  to  the  level  of    our  expectations.  we  fall  to  the  level  of  our  training
__label__0 plis  entren  al  grupo  del  eski!!!!!!!  !!
__label__0 i  won  the  midna  game  twice,  and  she  doesnt  die,  she  only  gets  like  in  a  shoc,  but  she  ends  up  alive  :),  anyway,  im  so  happy  to  talk  to  u,  how  is  everything  going  on  there?  how  are  neftali,  stephany,  lewis,  andre  and  everybody  else?

__label__0 happy  new  year!
__label__0 i  found  god  on  the  corner  of  st  and  amistad,  where  the  west  was  all  but  won.  all  alone,  smokin'  his  last  cigarette,  i  said,  "where  you  been?"  he  said  "ask  anything..."
__label__0 "so  come  on,  get  higher;  loosen  my  lips.  faith  and  desire  in  the  swing  of  your  hips,  just  to  pull  me  down  hard,  and  drown  me  in  love..."  ?  best  song  ever.  :)
__label__0 "so  maybe  it's  true  that  i  can't  live  without  you,  and  maybe  two  is  better  than  one..."
__label__0 "my  love,  i  forgive  you;  you  never  planned  to  die  -  and  love,  i'll  place  two  pennies  over  your  eyes...  and  i  will  love  you,  after  the  war.  i  love  you  for  always,  forever  more.  i  will  love  you,  after  the  war  -  forever,  for  always,  and  more..."
__label__0 wants  to  go  see  avatar!  argh!  :o
__label__0 going  down!  faster  would  be  nice,  though...  :p  haha!
__label__0 "i  thought  about  him  today,  and  everybody  who's  seen  what  he's  seen  -  from  a  woman  on  a  bus,  to  a  man  with  a  dream.  hey,  wake  up  *propname*;  welcome  to  the  future."  c:
__label__0 oh,  look  what  you've  done;  you've  made  a  fool  of  everyone.
__label__0 leaving  manitoba  wednesday  morning...  not  looking  forward  to  it!  :(
__label__0 somehow,  i  have  a  feeling  that  i'm  going  to  need  facebook  more  this  year...    and  sorry  for  dropping  out  of  contact  with  most  people  this  summer

__label__0 *propname*  is  now  single?  are  you  serious?  it  should  read,  "*propname*  has  been  single."  anyway,  wanna  go  out?  i'm  single.
__label__0 the  ladies  sweat  the  style  like  the  squirrel  sweats  the  nuts.  yet,  i'm  still  single.  must  be  rotten  nuts.
__label__0 anyone  want  to  pull  some  strings  so  i  can  get  into  grad  school?  also,  anyone  want  to  buy  my  house  so  i  can  go  to  grad  school?
__label__0 i  need  to  tell  people  i'm  single  more  often.  two  girls  talk  to  me  in  less  than    hours.  that's  like  twice  as  many  in  the  last  week.  wow.  i  feel  special.  that's  why  i  ride  the  short  bus.
__label__0 your  mom
__label__0 also,  what's  with  facebook  exploding?  i  can't  even  use  this  stupid  thing  anymore.  how  do  i  fix  my  profile?  wait,  there  it  is  underneath  the  couch  cushion  next  to  the  pocket  lint  hiding  under  the  chest  of  drawers  over  yonder  by  the  bureau
__label__0 yes,  mosquitos  in  ak  are  really  this  big.  it  is  actual  size.  the  size  of  a  grapefruit.  every  summer  at  least  three  people  die  from  mosquito  bites  in  ak.  we  need  to  do  something  about  global  warming,  the  mosquitos  are  planning  a  revolt!  akns  lives  depend  on  cool  temperatures!  please  think  of  the  alaskans!!!

__label__0 putting  up  my  wonderfully  fake  tree.  it  has  given  me  joy  (read  as  pain//hatred)  for  the  past  four  years  now.  now  it  can  grace  my  livingroom  yet  again!

__label__0 what's  with  everyone  going  to  bed  so  early?  the  night  is  still  within  the  nadir.  the  last  remnants  of  the  day  remain  like  a  youthful  child  reluctant  to  mature.  carpe  noctem!

__label__0 the  bike  home  for  lunch  is  rather  exhilarating  when  oversized  truck  make  right  turns  from  the  left  lane,  without  turn  signals.    at  least  do  it  when  the  light  is  green  maybe?
__label__0 finally  decided  on  a  new  name  for  kitty!  sassafras  :)
__label__0 sassafras  has  the  sniffles  :(
__label__0 is  so  glad  that  the  fire  alarm  will  save  us  from  excess  water  vapor.  .  .  from  the  dryer.    grrr.
__label__0 from  my  vet  school  app,  hours  i  have  spent  working  &  volunteering  with  animals  and  veterinarians:  
__label__0 marathon  on  the  square  at  pm  for  happy  hour?
__label__0 kitty  thinks  my  leg  is  fun  to  climb  up.    ow.    but  it's  hard  to  be  mad  when  the  purpose  of  the  climb  is  to  snuggle  with  me  :)
__label__0 is  kinda  glad  my  front  brake  is  now  functional,  otherwise  i  would  likely  have  been  squashed  by  a  little  yellow  car  today.
__label__0 just  got  a  kitten!!!    any  name  ideas  for  the  itty  bitty  kitty?
__label__0 mmmm.  .  .  cannibalism  day  in  my  dead  ppl  class  :)

__label__0 is  enjoying  the  cricket...comfy  boxers  and  rainy  weather...is  it  too  soon  for  a  beer?
__label__0 can't  believe  that  her  son  walked  up  to  the  christmas  tree  stating  'j'.  i  was  a  little  confused  until  he  took  a  candy  cane  off  the  tree  and  proceeded  to  turn  it  upside  down  :-d
__label__0 got  home  from  shopping  all  evening  (*propname*  and  kids  in  tow)  and  then  wrapped  presents  all  night...and  it  still  isnt  finished...*yawn*
__label__0 -  so,  this  morning  *propname*  gets  up  to  play  and  he  goes  over  to  the  carpet  where  the  light  was  shining  through  the  blinds  casting  shadows...he  then  proceeds  to  tell  me  the  different  letters  the  sun  is  making  on  the  carpet...  'i',  't'  and  'l'  to  be  exact!  he  then  somehow  figured  out  how  to  cast  his  shadow  over  the  sun  to  make  the  letters  change  &  disappear!  at  this  rate,  he  will  be  smarter  than  me  before  he  goes  to  school!
__label__0 needs  beer...actually,  any  kind  of  alcohol  will  do...
__label__0 is  sick  of  being  sick!
__label__0 is  enjoying  the  cricket  but  has  no  fingernails  left.

__label__0 i  did  the  macarena  with  a  pickle  at  the  dinner  table  because  the  voices  told  me  to.
__label__0 so...*propname*  can  now  count  backwards  from    :-)
__label__0 so...apparently,  according  to  urban  dictionary...a  women  named  *propname*  is  typically  very  beautiful  with  an  incredible  body  and  nice  eyes.  they  are  known  to  be  very  loveable.  *propname*  are  envied  by  other  women...haha...i  wish!
__label__1 preparing  the  different  meals  i  can  eat  for  my  "bulking"  diet  with  my  custom  workout  program  starting  tuesday.  in  theory  this  should  be  better  than  px,  hit,  x,  etc.  counting  calories  is  tedious,  but  it's  the  best  way  to  make  real  progress.
__label__1 exit  silicon  valley,  enter  silicone  valley

__label__0 i  haven't  opened  the  blinds  yet  but  from  the  sound  of  the  wind  and  the  rain  i  think  that  the  world  may  be  about  to  end...
__label__0 is  bloody  freezing....
__label__0 thanks  everyone  for  all  the  texts  etc...    finally  feeling  human  again!    i  don't  think  i've  ever  been  so  sick.    went  out  for  the  first  time  in    days  this  morning!  talk  about  cabin  fever...    back  to  work  on  wednesday  -  am  even  looking  forward  to  it!
__label__0 typical,  just  when  i'm  finally  able  to  go  out  again  it's  blowing  a  gale  and  bloody  raining...

__label__1 "all  the  old  bindings  are  broken.  cosmological  centers  now  are  anywhere  and  everywhere.  the  earth  is  a  heavenly  body,  most  beautiful  of  all,  and  all  poetry  now  is  archaic  that  fails  to  match  the  wonder  of  this  view."  -  *propname*,  *myths  to  live  by*
__label__1 need  someone  with  pr  experience  to  volunteer  their  time  to  help  with  racebending.org,  you  interested  in  helping  save  the  world?

__label__1 i  was  totally  freaked  out  tonight  while  driving  home  with  janice  at  am.  the  black  coupe  next  to  me  matched  my  speed  even  though  i  was  going  fast  and  then  he  continued  to  match  me  speed  as  i  slowed  down.  so  i  turn  to  look  at  the  driver  of  the  car  and  he's  wearing  a  mask.  a  rubber  mask  reminiscent  to  freddy  cruger.  _  i  almost  had  a  heart  attack.  i  then  slowed  down  a  lot  and  he  continued  on...  oh  my  goodness...
__label__1 in  my    min  stop  at  *c  bakery  in  irvine,  i  saw    people  i  knew...

__label__1 quite  possibly  the  worst  couple  days  ever:  yesterday  almost  cried  at  work.  i  apparently  have  the    worst  classes  in  the  school-  lowest  freshman  math.  who  i  see  for  four  periods.    and  which  stole  a  student's  wallet.

__label__0 back  in  cali!!!
__label__0 question:  what  would  have  happened  if  adam  and  eve  had  eaten  from  the  "tree  of  life"  before  eating  from  the  "tree  of  knowledge"?
__label__0 i  think  *propname*  is  quite  a  little  beuity.
__label__0 i'm  ecstatic!  i  just  spoke  briefly  with  *propname*'s  lawyer.  based  on  some  "case  files"  i  emailed  her,  we  have  enough  evidence  to  prove  cps's  removal  of  the  kids  was  illegal  and  grounds  for  an  emergency  hearing.  we  believe  we  have  enough  evidence  to  cost  both  cps  and  humble  pd  their  "qualified  immunity",  allowing  us  to  file  a  civil  suit  against  them  and  the  apartments.  anyone  know  a  good  civil  attorney???
__label__0 *propname*'s  kids  won  in  kbxx-.  "madd  hatta's  elves"  christmas  contest.  they  get  to  go  to  an  invitation  only  christmas  party  at  dave  &  busters  monday  morning.  unfortunately.  *propname*'s  daddy  does  not  want  to  let  him  go  because  of  all  the  cps  stuff.
__label__0 things  went  better.  *propname*  was  able  to  retain  her  composur  and  not  break  down  in  court.  the  judge  referred  the  case  to  "mediation".  we  go  to  that  jan  th.
__label__0 lord  willing  and  with  his  blessing.  i  claim  in  the  name  of  jesus:  "today  we  get  the  kids  back."  all  prayers  are  welcome.
__label__0 please  keep  *propname*'s  family  in  your  prayers  tonight  and  tomorrow.  we  have  to  be  in  court  at  am.  really  pray  for  the  oldest  *propname*  went  to  his  dad's  for  his  summer  visit  and  had  his  mother,  brother  and  sister  stripped  from  him  for  six  months.  cps  is  providing  christmas  for  the  other  two  but  not  him.    i  sure  hope  we  succeed  at  stripping  them  of  their  "immunity"  and  make  them  pay  for  what  they've  done  to  this  family.
__label__0 i  stopped  by  and  visited  with  *propname*  and  *propname*.  only  stayed  about  twenty  minutes.  i  sure  will  be  glad  when  they  can  come  back  home.
__label__0 well  we  are  on  hold  until  next  wed.  both  casa  and  cps  are  demanding  current  prescription  records  all  though  they  have  through  the  last  court  date  and  did  not  request  these  until  yesterday.  *propname*'s  theropist  did  not  show  either,  but  he  is  being  supenaed  for  wed.
__label__0 *propname*  just  told  me  tuesday,  that  her  cancer  has  progressed  to  stage  .
__label__0 could  teenage  "huffing"  be  the  result  of  modern  day  child  proofing  and  the  parent  neglecting  to  actually  teach  the  child,  "that  will  kill  you".
__label__0 can  anyone  out  there  tell  me  if  jesus  was  ever  anointed  in  oil?  he  was  babtized  in  water  and  anointed  in  the  holy  spirt  which  is  why  he  is  called  the  "anointed  one".  can  anyone  tell  me  yes  or  no.  if  yes  i  need  scripture  reference.  thank  you.
__label__0 go  gators!    and  ....  now,  lets  see  if  the  vols  help  us  clench  the  sec  east  :)  oh,  and  happy  halloween!!!
__label__0 enjoyed  the  football  and  fun  of  the  weekend,  and  now  its  back  to  reality.
__label__0 i  love  mondays....  can  every  one  grasp  the  sarcasm  in  that  statement.  i  hope  so.
__label__0 i  don't  understand  why  some  people  make  it  so  hard  for  you  to  be  nice  to  them.  i  dont  understand  why  i'm  worrying  about  it  anyway,  they  sure  aren't.
__label__0 thanksgiving  cooking!  fun  or  stressful,  i'll  decide  later.
__label__0 its  friday!
__label__0 to  my  veteran  friends,  family,  and  strangers  alike;  i  would  like  to  say  thank  you.  thank  you  for  the  sacrifices  you  have  made  for  my  safety,  my  freedoms,  and  my  country.  god  bless  you  all.
__label__0 just  can't  get  into  the  monay  state  of  mind.
__label__0 who  can  tell  me  how  to  not  be  a  fan  of  something  anymore?
__label__0 i  don't  want  to  get  sick,  but  i  think  it's  happening  anyway  :(
__label__0 can't  decided  if  she  is  going  to  jacksonville  saturday  or  not.
__label__0 hooray!  home  from  work.
__label__0 what  was  lsu  thinking?
__label__0 do  you  remember  that  song  "break  stuff"  by  limp  bizkit?  thats  kind  of  the  day  i'm  having.
__label__0 back  to  work.  trying  to  get  everything  cleaned  up  before  the  new  year.  if  you  saw  my  desk,  you  would  understand  why  i  am  starting  now  :)
__label__0 merry  christmas!
__label__0 people  should  not  encourage  me  to  drink  until    o'clock  in  the  morning  :(
__label__0 and  the  bucs  pull  it  out  in  overtime!  way  to  go!
__label__0 *propname*  leaves  the  sec,  hooray
__label__0 i  have  so  happy  the  ravens  are  getting  a  good  start  today!  i  love  playoff  football.
__label__0 i'm  getting  calls  back  on  my  resume,  it  makes  me  hopefull  i  will  find  the  right  job  :)
__label__0 i  just  can't  get  into  the  swing  of  things  today.
__label__0 what  sad  news  for  the  gator  nation  today,  the  resignation  of  urban  meyer.  our  prayers  will  be  with  coach  meyer  and  his  family.
__label__0 upon  what  basis  do  we  judge  other  people?  is  it  ithe  experiances  that  we  ourselves  have,  or  the  belifes  in  which  we  hold?
__label__0 is  unemployed,  and  thinks  its  a  good  thing  :)
__label__0 i  know  many  people  have  faced  this  issue  before,  but  mit  graduate  admissions  should  stop  denying  the  existence  of  caltech...
__label__0 according  to  a  certain  oil//gas  industry  recruiter,  .  <  ..
__label__0 it's  creepy  how  facebook  suggests  that  a  certain  friend  has  too  few  friends.
__label__0 it's  really  irksome  when  a  grad  school  application  recognizes  'california  institute  of  locksmithing'  but  not  'california  institute  of  technology.'
__label__0 contra  costa  county  is  now  recruiting  prison  cooks  at  caltech.    i  didn't  know  they  needed  prison  cooks  that  badly.    besides,  there's  probably  a  .  gpa  requirement  somewhere...
__label__0 we  consider  a  pure  gas  composed  of  rigid,  nonattracting  spherical  molecules  of  diameter  d  and  mass  m,  and  the  number  density  (number  of  molecules  per  unit  volume)  is  taken  to  be  n.
__label__0 apparently  "california  institute  of  technology"  is  too  long  a  name  for  mit  graduate  admissions.
__label__0 the  moral  of  ninja  assassins:  if  you're  ever  attacked  by  black  pajama-clad  assassins,  your  only  chance  of  survival  is  riding  in  a  volkswagen  eos.
__label__0 just  realized  that  it's  cheaper  to  run  his  car  on  lard  in  texas  ($.//gallon)  than  on  diesel  ($.//gallon)  in  the  uk.
__label__0 i  love  how  techers  are  always  tagged  as  "the  smart  one."
__label__0 told  the  guy  behind  the  fish  counter  to  gut  a  catfish  by  mimicing  longitudinal  write  slices.
__label__0 fun(  baiting  russian  trolls)  >  fun(  baiting  generic  trolls)
__label__0 what's  this  song  i'm  hearing  on  the  radio  with  sirens,  screams  and  gunshots?    oh  right,  it's  "santa  claus  is  coming  to  town."
__label__0 good  thing  caltech  doesn't  have  a  front  gate;  otherwise,  someone  would  write  "wirklichkeit  macht  frei"  on  top.
__label__0 my  family  now  has    car//person,  down  from  .  cars//person.
__label__0 the  aeropress  is  back  in  business.    america,  fuck  yeah!
__label__0 //.    finally  done.
__label__0 my    *propname*  has  a  ridiculously  sharp  throttle  response.    i  wonder  if  it  has  anything  to  do  with  the  unintended  acceleration  problems...
__label__0 wonders  why  engineers  are  overrepresented  in  terrorist  organizations.
__label__0 mass  effect  :  it's  nice  to  see  that  the  nigerian    scam  is  still  going  strong  in  ,  this  time  with  batarians  trying  to  recover  quarantined  prothean  artifacts.
__label__0 i  don't  know  why  new  car  dealers  in  houston  insist  on  all-season  tires  on  all  their  products.    we  have  snow  one  day  every    years!
__label__0 note  to  'the  wildlife  fund':  fuck  you,  stop  pestering  me  about  your  $  'donation'  to  my  nonexistent  'zoo'.
__label__0 dear  bioware:  dragon  age  is  a  wonderful  and  entertaining  game,  but  epic  fail  on  the  load  times.    at  least  make  the  wait  entertaining.    instead  of  blood  tracks  on  a  map  (or  awkward  elevator  rides),  how  about  a  d  hack  'n  slash  minigame?
__label__0 southern  rap:  oh,  the  amazing  things  you  can  do  with  a  minimalist  palette  of  shouts,  chants,  and  grunts.
__label__0 stanford  says  no.  :(
__label__0 flu  sucks
__label__0 back  to  work  sucks,  especially  when  you  have  the  double  wammy  of  being  nocturnal  and  freezing  limbs
__label__0 scored  another  interview!!!!!!
__label__0 why  is  it  that  we  only  realize  our  own  insignificance,  when  we  vainly  reach  for  the  stars?
__label__0 black
