    "summary": "I am Rukshan Jayasekara. I am currently a final year undergraduate at Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology. I'm following the BSc Hons Information Technology degree program specializing in Software Engineering. I did my OLs and ALs at D.S Senanayake College, Colombo 07. Last year I completed an internship at 99x. During my internship with 99x, I gained hands-on experience coding under the direction of a team, collaborating on software projects, and testing systems and applications. The project I worked on was an Intelligent Knowledge Management Platform and the project was on the way to becoming an Intelligent Knowledge Experience Platform. A key part of that upgrade was, for the platform to be able to handle interactive content rather than just static content. One of my main objectives was to research and implement an interactive content service, which I managed to do within my internship period. During my internship period, I worked with Angular, Node.js, Serverless framework, MongoDB, and AWS, and followed Agile Scrum practices. I love team work. I have lead a lot of my assignments groups in the university, including the final year research. The main technologies I have used include MERN stack, Java, SQL, NoSQL, and Docker. Last year I received a scholarship from SLIIT and got selected for the Deanâ€™s List. Other than the degree I have taken part in numerous extra-curricular activities at the university. Acting as a Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador, participating in competitive coding competitions where I managed to get Merit achievements can be named as some of them. I also love self-learning. Following online courses, answering Stack Overflow questions and open source contributions are the three main methods I use for self-learning. I also maintain a technical blog where I write about the new things I learn. As for the hobbies, I love working out, watching football and TV series."
