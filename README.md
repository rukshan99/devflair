# "devFlair": A Tool for Personality and Technical Skill Analysis Using LinkedIn, Stack Overflow and GitHub data (2022-014)

## Main Objective

To create a web-based personality and technical skill analytics tool based on LinkedIn, Stack Overflow, and GitHub data with Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning to help recruiters to recruit the best possible candidates among many.

## Research Problem

Most of the time the recruiter needs to go through every candidate's personal LinkedIn, Stack Overflow, and GitHub profiles to manually evaluate whether they fulfill the job requirements. During this process, the hidden details to identify certain personality traits can go unattended due to human error. Current LinkedIn analytics tools focus on the engagement of the audiences and marketing aspects rather than personality aspects. Also, the information about technical skills posted on LinkedIn may be inaccurate, out of date, and subjective. However, on the other hand, the data regarding technical skills on platforms like Stack Overflow and GitHub are much more accurate and up to date.
